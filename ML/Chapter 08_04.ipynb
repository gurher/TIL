Important rookie cards in it are:\\n>Mogilny, Roenick, Belfour, Recchi, Stevens, Jagr, Nolan, Nedved, Ricci, \\n>Sundin, Modano, Richter and others! The Beckett price is $42, but I'm\\n>Charging $45 to cover the Shipping and Packaging.\\n\\nI've sold one, but I still have 2 left for sale. I also realize that $45 is\\nalot of money, especially if you don't normally collect cards. So if enough\\npeople are interested, I'll break up the set into team sets. I'm not sure\\nhow much for each. It would be nice to just sell them for $3 each, but then\\nthe people who get the Whalers and Devils (Note, I'm not bagging on these teams\\nits just that they don't have alot of good rookie cards in this set) would\\nbe subsidizing the people who want Chicago or Pittsburgh. So I'll have to make\\nit varialble pricing. But most of them should be about $2 or $3 dollars.\\n\\n\\n>1991-92 Score Pinnacle (Candian) Sets $45\\n\\n>This is a very nice set, premium quality cards. Has second year cards of the\\n>players above, plus Bure, Potvin, Falloon, and Lindros ($15 value) second year\\n>cards,and the following rookie cards: Lidstrom Kamensky, Zelepukin, Roussel,\\n>Konstantinov. Beckett Price is $50, but I have alot of these.\\n\\n>1991-92 Upperdeck Czechoslovakian Set $60\\n\\n>This is a 100 card set of the 92 World Junior Tournament. Meant for sale in\\n>Czechoslovakia, but didn't sell well there, and some of it filtere back in\\n>to the US. The cards are Bilingual. Has Lachance, Kovalev, and Straka Rookies.\\n>If your interested, please e-mail me. Thanks\\n\\nOk someone asked for this one, but he's from Canada, if he can get me the\\nmoney in US funds then its his, if not, the first person who writes in will\\nbe the alternate.\\n\\nAlso I would like to sell 2 Upperdeck Pavel Bure rookie cards (note these\\nare not in the UD low #'s set mentioned above). $16 each.

These people -- and those associated with them\\n    (\"Now there were with us seven brethren\", Matt. 22:25) -- would not\\n    be receptive to such higher blessings as eternal marriage.  Hence,\\n    the people in the story would likely not be married in the eterni-\\n    ties; but that doesn\\'t mean other, more faithful people could not\\n    have this blessing.\\n\\n(2) Jesus was making a distinction between the state or condition of\\n    =being= married, and the process of =becoming= married.  The latter\\n    activity (marrying and giving in marriage) will not take place in\\n    the eternities, because all eternal marriages will be taken care of\\n    before then.\\n\\n(3) The account as we have it (in all three of the synoptic Gospels) is\\n    missing something that would make its real meaning clearer.  Note\\n    that we (LDS) do not believe in Biblical inerrancy, so we do not in\\n    general feel obliged to reconcile each and every Bible text with\\n    modern revelation through Joseph Smith and other latter-day proph-\\n    ets.  Nor are we particularly upset that the account in question\\n    was not significantly revised in the \"Joseph Smith Translation\" or\\n    \"Inspired Version\" of the Bible, since we do not believe this work\\n    was completed or that failure to revise a passage in the JST con-\\n    stitutes divine approval of that passage as it stands in the KJV.\\n\\n-- \\nRich Wales <richw@mks.com>       //      Mortice Kern Systems Inc.

Cooper is\\nthe government\\'s only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan.\\nSpence attacked Cooper\\'s credibility by pointing out discrepancies\\nbetween Cooper\\'s statements last September and those made in court.\\nCooper conceded that, \"You have all these things compressed into\\na few seconds...It\\'s difficult to remember what went on first.\"\\n\\nCooper acknowledged that he carried a \"9mm Colt Commando submachine\\ngun with a silenced barrel.\" [I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver!]\\nCooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific\\nplans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver\\'s dog.\\n\\nWhen Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan\\'s\\nM-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead, Cooper could not say for\\nsure that Degan did not return fire before going down.\\n\\nSpence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent)\\nhad Cooper discussed last August\\'s events, Cooper responded, \"If\\nyou\\'re implying that we got our story together, you\\'re wrong,\\ncounselor.\"  Spence continued to advance the defense\\'s version of\\nthe events: Namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by\\nkilling the Weaver\\'s dog.  Cooper disagreed.\\n\\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence\\'s\\nvirulent cross-examination of agent Cooper, arguing that the questions\\nwere repetitive and Spence was wasting time.  Howen also complained \\nthat Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the\\ndefense\\'s version of the events.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge\\nsustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted\\nuntil Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to\\nadmonish both attorneys.  \"I\\'m not going to play games with either\\ncounsel.  This has been a personality problem from day 1, so start\\nacting like professionals.\"\\n\\nSpence told the judge that, \"When all the evidence is in, we\\'ll see\\nthat ... his [agent Larry Cooper] testimony is not credible, that\\nhe was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events.\" \\nSpence continued, \"We\\'re going to find...that there is a very unlikely\\nsimilarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between\\nthe testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses.\"\\n\\nSpence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen\\'s repeated\\nobjections would prevent a fair trial, \"We can\\'t have a fair trial if the\\njury believes I\\'m some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes I\\'m\\nbending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I\\'m\\nviolating court orders.\"\\n\\nJudge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen\\'s\\nobjections had somehow prejudiced the jury was \"preposterous\" and\\ndenied the motion for a mistrial.  Lodge did tell Howen to restrict\\nhis comments when objecting.\\n\\nThe trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg\\nRampton.  The prosecution\\'s purpose was simply to introduce five\\nweapons found in the cabin as evidence: However, the defense seized\\non the opportunity to further address Cooper\\'s credibility.\\n\\nDefense attorney Ellison Matthews (Harris\\' other attorney) questioned\\nRampton about the dog.  Rampton stated that there were no specific\\nplans to kill the Weaver\\'s dog without being detected.  Matthews then\\nhad Rampton read  a Septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which Rampton\\nhad said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon\\nwas to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them.\\nRampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that,\\nbut he could not remember when.  He then stated that, \"I did not conduct\\nthe primary interview with Deputy Cooper, but I have had conversations\\nwith him since the interview was conducted.\"\\n\\nMonday, April 19, 1993 will begin the fifth day of the trial.

Imake support has been improved, a few defaults have\\nbeen changed, and a lot of other small things have been added.\\n\\nThis is basically a release which drops the \\'gamma\\' status. Next release will\\nincorporate some improvements by Stefan Schwarz, and possibly will support\\nX11R5 and Motif 1.2.x.\\n\\nNote to all of those who keep copies of the archive: please retrieve this\\ndistribution (during off-peak hours), and delete all previous copies.\\n\\nHere is the original ANNOUNCEMENT:\\n\\nHISTORY\\n\\nThe University of Lowell, supported by a grant of the Open Software Foundation,\\nhas developed a wrapper-library, that encapsulates Motif widgets in C++\\nclasses. All resources of these Widgets can now be set through\\nmember-functions, while objects can be used in callback-functions. The library\\nwas made available for free or nominal cost for anonymous ftp at 129.63.1.1.\\nHowever, the library contained a large number of bugs and oversights, and only\\nworked under X11R3. Due to lack of subsequent fundings, the bindings are no\\nlonger actively supported by the University of Lowell.\\n\\nI, Ronald van Loon, at a certain point last year, have taken the Lowell \\nbindings, fixing the bugs I came across, adding missing memberfunctions, and\\nenhancing functionality and made the bug-fixed library available for the\\ngeneral public for anonymous ftp (made possible by Rick Murphy at DEC).\\n\\nNEW RELEASE\\n\\nI am now pleased to announce a new and updated release of the Motif++\\nbindings. \\n\\nThis release offers:\\n\\n- Full Motif1.1 and X11R4 support\\n- Support for Xbae widgetset \\n- Two additional widgets, written by myself, that can be used to indicate\\n  progress in an application.\\n- Imake support. NB: this release relies heavily on the existence of imake\\n\\t\\t     and its config files on your site. I have tried to\\n\\t\\t     provide the bindings with a standard Makefile, tweakable\\n\\t\\t     for those unfortunates without imake. I have not severely\\n\\t\\t     tested the standard Makefile though. Contact me if you\\n\\t\\t     have problems. The reason for calling this a gamma\\n\\t\\t     release lies in the fact that I do not have a multitude\\n\\t\\t     of platforms to test the Imake-files on.\\n- Lots of testfiles (even somewhat useful programs)\\n- An article I wrote on the usage of Motif, X and C++, previously posted\\n  on Usenet.\\n\\nWHERE TO GET THE NEW MOTIF BINDINGS\\n\\nFtp:\\n\\nAnonymous ftp at decuac.dec.com (192.5.214.1), directory /pub/X11.\\n\\nNote:\\n\\nPlease be patient as the network link is quite slow.

Anyway, back\\nto current affairs,\\n\\n>Rushdie has, by his own admission, drawn\\n>on the version given by [the orientalist] Watt \\n\\nAmong others; this incident is not something Rushdie or Watt or anyone\\nelse dug up from nowhere, it is a well known story, a myth if you\\nwill, known (according to Umar Khan) to \"Every Muslim school boy and\\ngirl\", and so presumably to Rushdie, and to Gibreel Farishta.\\n\\n>and then allowed his\\n>imagination to run wild \\n\\nYes, this is what writing fiction is all about.  Rushdie was writing\\nabout a crisis of faith, and chose this myth to present it, by placing\\nthe actor \"Gibreel\" in the role of the angel whose name he took.\\nRushdie was not writing a history or theology book, and nowhere claims\\nor implies that this is what actually happened.  It\\'s somewhat like\\nstories woven around the relationship between Jesus and the reformed\\nprostitute Mary Magdalene (another myth).  Or those referring to the\\nArthurian mythos, or the Grail legend, or the Wandering Jew, or dozens\\nof others.  If you can stand to read the work of a blasphemer,\\nconsider Salman Rushdie\\'s children\\'s book \"Haroun and the Sea of\\nStories\" for an idea of the way a storyteller -- a specific\\nstoryteller -- works with existing story lines.\\n\\n>to ridicule Muhammad\\'s integrity...\\n\\nNo.  Muhammad\\'s [Mahound\\'s] integrity is not really impugned in this\\npart of the story, and there\\'s no reason to think this was Rushdie\\'s\\nintent: Gibreel, as the archangel, produces the verses (divine and\\nsatanic), though he doesn\\'t know their provenance.  It is not implied\\n(in a straight reading) that Muhammad influences them:\\n\\n    \" *Not my voice* I\\'d never know such words I\\'m no classy speaker\\n    never was never will be but this isn\\'t my voice it\\'s a Voice.\\n      Mahound\\'s eyes open wide, he\\'s seeing some kind of vision,\\n    staring at it, oh, that\\'s right, Gibreel remembers, me.  He\\'s\\n    seeing me.  My lips moving, being moved by.  What, whom?  Don\\'t\\n    know, can\\'t say.

Is it Satan?\\nOr something else?  The answer is not given.\\n\\nTo be sure, the question is raised.  This novel explores faith and the\\nrole of revelation in religion, among other things.  Addressing loss\\nof faith implicitly raises questions about the truth of revelation,\\nbut this novel proposes no answers, at least not directly.  The very\\nexistence of a newsgroup named \"alt.atheism\" raises the same\\nquestions, more forcefully, and does propose some answers, which is\\nthe real relevance.  If Rushdie\\'s mild fictional exploration is \"filth\\nand lies\", and he \"asked for what he got\", are we next on the fatwa\\nlist?

Look for Daystar and such to make PowerPC\\naccelerators.\\n\\nOne potential problem with any accelerator, though, is that it will\\nneed a ROM companion and Apple has licensed only Radius, with\\nRocketshare, to use any of its proprietary code.\\n\\nApple is, between the lines, trying to let us know that PowerPC Macs\\nwill have simplified logic boards due to the magical nature of RISC\\nand that these boards should be much cheaper to build than those in\\nexisting 68040 Macs. Perhaps, then, we\\'ll see groundbreaking\\nprices in Mac-logic board upgrades, much the same way we\\'ve seen\\nmuch cheaper high-performance CPUs this year.\\n\\nFirst generation PowerPCs, 98601s, will also hopefully have socketed\\nCPUs so that they\\'ll be chip upgradeable to 98604s a year later.\\nThis should be possible in much the same way that 486s can be pulled\\nfor clock doublers. If there is too much technical   baggage (which\\nI doubt since the external busses are the same size/width) to do\\nthis, perhaps we can have CPU daughterboard, a la Powerbook, as\\nstandard to facilitate better CPU upgrades. This is an area where\\nApple has fallen far behing the Intel-based world.

There were literally thousands\\n  of incidents continuously until World War I, in Southeastern Europe as far\\n  west and north as Monastir and Kavalla, in Istanbul, at Gallipoli and\\n  the Dardanelles, at Salonica, and in all the Arab provinces as far south\\n  as Damascus and Beirut and in Egypt at Cairo and Alexandria. These\\n  invariably resulted from accusations spread among Ottoman Christians\\n  by word of mouth, or published in their newspapers, often by Christian\\n  financiers and merchants anxious to get their Jewish competitors out of\\n  the way or to divert onto the Jews Muslim anger at reports of Christian\\n  massacres of Muslims in Southeastern Europe or Central Asia, resulting\\n  in individual and mob attacks on Jews, and the burning of their shops\\n  and homes.\\n\\n  Individual experiences were horrible. Jews constantly went in fear of\\n  Armenian or Greek attacks in the streets of Ottoman cities. In Egypt\\n  and Syria, it was usually the Greeks who led the way, in many cases\\n  with the assistance of local Armenians and Syrian Christians, whose\\n  Greek, Arabic and French-language newspapers often printed all the\\n  rumors they could find regarding Jews, evidently with the desire of\\n  instigating violence. The Syrian Arab Christians in particular spread\\n  their long-standing anti-Semitic hatreds from Syria to Egypt, where\\n  their monopoly of the local press and their espousal of popular causes\\n  such as Egyptian nationalism and opposition to the British rule, enabled\\n  them to spread their anti-Jewish message among the Muslim masses with\\n  little question or opposition.\\n\\n  On 20 June 1890, thus, Sir Evelyn Baring (later Lord Cromer), British\\n  High Commissioner in Egypt, received the following report from David\\n  and Nissim Ades, in Cairo:\\n\\n    \\'\\'Sir,\\n\\n      I beg sir to draw to your attention to the violent articles which\\n      has (sic) appeared in an Arabic paper called El Mahroussa which\\n      contained nothing but lies and false accusations against the Jews,\\n      especially those (the issues) of the 14th, 17th and 19th instant.\\n      Now, Sir, are we to have here an anti-Semitic party amidst fanaticism,\\n      Greeks, Armenians, etc., or is he to be allowed to continue to poison\\n      the people\\'s minds with exaggeration and painted words?

All homicides must be shown, per capita, not  \\n: just handguns.  The availability of them in the USA makes them the preferred  \\n: murder weapon, but ban them, and some other weapon will step in as the  \\n: favorite.\\n\\nAs a \"favorite\", sure.  As lethal, not likely.  A study of violence in\\nChicago produced this table:\\n\\n\\t\\tPercentage of Reported Gun and Knife Attacks\\n\\t\\t\\t    Resulting in Death\\n\\t\\t\\t    \\n\\tWeapon\\t\\t\\t\\tDeaths As Percentage of Attacks\\n\\t---------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\tKnives (16,518 total attacks)\\t\\t 2.4\\n\\tGuns (6,350 total attacks)\\t\\t12.2\\n\\n\\tSource: Firearms and Violence in American Life\\n\\t\\nIt might be contended that if gun murderers were deprived of guns\\nthat they would find a way to kill as often with knives.  If this were\\nso, knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide\\nwould be expected to show a low fatality rate, and knife attacks in\\ncities where guns were not so widely used (like Vancouver) would show\\na higher fatality rate.  But the Nat\\'l Commission on the Causes and\\nPrevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found this\\nnot to be the case.  It appeared to them that as the number of knife\\nattacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks\\n(which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants),\\nthe proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to the\\nproportion of gun attacks.  In fact, the reverse was true.\\n\\nWhat was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on\\nthe part of the assailant to kill.  Fatalities caused by knife tended\\nto show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave\\nphysical injury: multiple stabs wounds, wounds concentrated about the\\nhead neck and chest, etc.  Most gun homicides did not show this\\npattern.  Rather, more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of\\nrage and not the focused intent to kill the victim.\\n\\n\\tSource: Report on Firearms and Violence\\n\\n: Then, since England != USA (my ancestors left because of the oppression) you  \\n: must compare England before strict gun laws to England after strict gun laws to  \\n: be able to draw any meaning at all.  England has essentially legalized drugs,  \\n: so there are no drug gangs battling for turf, etc., there.  If you drop out the  \\n: drug related killings here, the USA would look a whole lot more peaceful.\\n\\nThere are a lot of factors which make a difference.  Actually, I\\'m not\\nfond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans and\\nAmericans. There are more cultural, beahvioral and economic\\ndifferences between us than similarities.  I just sort of found\\nmyself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks.  I\\ndon\\'t think we could ever attain the low levels of European violent\\ncrime here in the US, whether we banned guns or required every\\nlaw-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi.\\n\\nOn the other hand, we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more\\nculturally similar, namely the Canadians.  In fact, an exhaustive,\\nseven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates\\nof Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington... cities\\nwith roughly the same population, urban economy, geography\\nand crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control.\\n\\nIn Seattle, handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense.  After\\na 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed\\nweapon.  The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted.\\n\\nIn Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason\\nto purchase a handgun.  Concealed weapons are not permitted.\\nRecreational uses of handguns (target shooting, collecting) are\\nregulated by the province.  Purchase of a handgun requires a\\nrestricted-weapons permit.  A permit to carry may be obtained in\\norder to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs.  Handguns\\ntransported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box.\\nIn short, gun control but not unreasonably so.\\n\\nBoth cities aggressively enforce their gun laws.  Convictions for\\ngun-related offenses carry similar penalties.  The researchers\\nstudied all cases of robbery, assault (simple and aggravated),\\nburglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from\\n1/1/80 to 12/31/86. In defining the cases, they used the same\\nstandard: the FBI\\'s Unified Crime Report.\\n\\nResults: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in\\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver\\n(1.09 / 1.11).  Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99).\\n18,925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12,034 in\\nVancouver.  The risk of being a victim of a simple assault in\\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver (1.18 /\\n1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher\\n(1.16 / 1.12).  However, when aggravated assaults were subdivided by\\nweapon and the mechanism of assault, a clear pattern emerged.\\nAlthough both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated\\nassault involving knives and other dangerous weapons, firearms were\\nfar more likely to be used in Seattle.  In fact, 7.7 times as often.\\n\\nOver the seven-year study, 388 homicides occurred in Seattle\\n(11.3 per 100,000) vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver (6.9 per 100,000).\\nAfter adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations,\\nthe relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle, as\\ncompared to Vancouver, was found to be 1.63.\\n\\nWhen homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death, the rate\\nof homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) in\\nSeattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver.\\nVirtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due to\\na more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms.  Handguns\\naccounted for roughly 85% of homicides involving firearms.  Handguns\\nwere 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle than\\nin Vancouver.\\n\\nThe authors of the report also investigated \"legally justifiable\"\\nhomicides (self-defense).  Only 32 such homicides occurred during\\nthe seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police.  Only\\n21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 in\\nSeattle and 4 in Vancouver.  Only 13 involved firearms.  After\\nexcluding these cases, there was virtually no impact on these\\nearlier findings.\\n\\n-------\\n\\nThis is, I feel, a very fair report.  One might even make the\\nargument that it is biased against Canada as a whole because\\nVancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times\\nthat of Ottawa, Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reports\\nannual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of NYC,\\nChicago, Los Angeles and Houston.\\n\\nCritics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access\\nto handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because\\npersons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a\\ngun or will kill by other means.  This report shows differently.\\nIf the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by\\nthe strength of intent than by the availability of weapons, we\\ncould expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to\\nbe higher in Vancouver than in Seattle.  However, during the study\\ninterval, Vancouver\\'s rate of homicide by weapons other than guns\\nwas not significantly higher than that in Seattle, suggesting that\\nfew would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods.\\n\\nAs well, ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abiding\\ncitizens was not endorsed in this report.  Although Seattle did\\nexperience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense, these\\ncases accounted for less than 4% of the homicides in both cities\\nduring the course of the study period.  And, as was reported,\\nSeattle apparently didn\\'t enjoy relief from any crime category\\nover Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for\\nself-defense.\\n\\n\\tHeavily quoted source: Handgun Regulation, Crime,\\n\\tAssaults, and Homicide: A Tale of Two Cities.\\n\\n\\tJohn H.

Although he left the detention installation\\nin Tulkarm bruised and humiliated (\"I sat at home for ten days. My\\nhands shook from nerves\"), one may consider Omar Jaber lucky: He\\ngot out, not so healthy, but entire, and even ultimately returned\\nto normal functioning, at the small solar heater plant he owns.\\n\\nIn contrast, Hassan Bader al-Zbeidi, for example, was released\\nseven weeks ago from detention in Tulkarm after 33 days in the\\nShabak wing, cut off from his surroundings. He doesn\\'t speak or\\nreact. Mustafa Barakat, aged only 23, who was arrested in early\\nAugust and was brought to the Tulkarm detention installation, left\\nit one day later - dead. \"We have recently received an especially\\nlarge number of testimonies concerning cruel tortures employed at\\nthe Tulkarm detention installation by Shabak interrogators\", noted\\nDr. Niv Gordon, director of the Association of Israel and\\nPalestinian Physicians for Human Rights.

But the Shabak interrogation wing is a separate kingdom. In\\nearly March the IDF allowed representatives of B\\'Tselem, the\\nIsraeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Territories, to\\nvisit Tulkarm prison, but denied them access to the interrogation\\nwing. \"The interrogation wing is Shabak property, being solely\\nunder Shabak responsibility.

In 1985\\nthe New York Times reported that government investigators broke\\nup a narcotics ring that was operating highly sophisticated\\nequipment capable of allowing the leaders of the ring to\\neavesdrop on the law-enforcement agents who were trying to arrest\\nthem.\\n     A Mr. Deely, an NSA official, said \"There are a lot of\\nmedium-sized countries that would have been proud to have the\\nsignals intelligence operation of this group.\"\\n     For every John Gotti there are probably many more people who\\nhave the sophistication to know what the risks of unsecure\\ncommunications are.  The press given to the Big Brother chip will\\nonly increase their numbers.\\n     Even if there is some benefit to law-enforcement through the\\nuse of Big Brother, it must be weighed against the constitutional\\nand civil liberties questions involved.\\n     For example, in some areas of the world torture is used as\\nan investigative tool by the local \"law-enforcement\" people.  I\\nsuspect it is an effective means of obtaining information and\\nshortening many investigations.  It probably also helps keep the\\nconviction rate high.\\n     The fact that the torture tool is not used in this country\\n(even with a court order obtained by showing \"probable cause\") is\\nbecause we have rightly balanced the questions of expediency and\\nwhat is ethically and morally right.\\n     I think that the same question of expediency versus morality\\nshould come into play when considering the use of Big Brother.  I\\nvote for morality.\\n     I am quite disturbed by what I interpret as a veiled threat\\nto prohibit the use of all encryption if this Big Brother chip is\\nnot put into wide spread use.  After a quick reading of the White\\nHouse press release I came away with that impression.\\n     To most of the American public, the word \"hacker\" has\\nrightly or wrongly come to mean \"high tech adolescent vandal\".\\nIt has struck me that most of the people posting to sci.crypt\\nregarding this issue are intelligent, thoughtful individuals who\\nhave genuine concerns about the privacy and constitutional issues\\nsurrounding Big Brother.  I hope that the use of Big Brother does\\nnot become mandatory and other encryption become illegal.  I\\nwould hate to see this become some kind of high tech Volstead\\nAct.\\n     The high speed digital communications revolution is coming\\nat us with the speed of an SST.  The times they are a changing,\\nand just as IBM is learning that they can\\'t do business the same\\nway they have done it for the past 40 years, maybe NSA should\\nevaluate another approach.\\n     EFF, who have correctly questioned the cryptographic\\nstrength of Big Brother, may need to send a stronger message out\\nregarding the constitutional issues involved.\\n     Al Gore may want to think this one through a little more.\\n     And as for Dorothy Elizabeth Robling Denning: En quoi cela\\nvous concerne, cheri?\\n',\n",

In OT, Tonelli scored the game\\nwinner to send the Isles to the next round. The Isles have lacked this tenacity\\nfor years, but perhaps its BACK!

The\\ntwo SHABAK interrogators who were responsible for his death were put\\non trial. In September \\'91 the Supreme Court rejected their appeal and\\nsentenced them to 6 months in prison.  As far as is known, this was\\nthe first time in Israel\\'s history that SHABAK operatives were sent to\\nprison.  The Supreme Court unanimously rejected the warning by the\\ndirector of SHABAK that the sentence will be detrimental the\\neffectiveness of other interrogators. [...] The judges in the case\\nwere [...] Barak, Goldberg, and Matza.\\n\\nWhen they realized that they were on their own, the interrogators\\nagreed to talk.  Deputy State Attorney Rachel Sukkar[sp?] was placed\\nin charge of investigating the affair.  She [...] questioned the\\ndirectors of all SHABAK divisions.

She discovered that not only torture,\\nbut also \"the culture of lies\", which Judge Landau had described in\\nhis report of two years before, were still very much in existence. \\nNothing had changed.\\n\\nThe report was classified and was seen by only some ten people, among\\nthem the Prime Minister, the people at the top of the judicial system\\nand Judge Landau.  The director of SHABAK claimed that he did not\\nknow.  After all, they were dealing only with a single jail and with\\nlow ranking people.  The system bit the bullet and accepted the\\nexplanation.  One of SHABAK\\'s high-ranking officials was transfered\\nfrom his very high position to a less high position.\\n\\n. . .\\n\\n[\"The culture of lies\" referred to above is the SHABAK interrogators\\'\\npolicy of lying in court when denying detainees claims that they were\\ntortured in the course of interrogation.  The Landau commission sought\\nto correct this problem by legalizing a list of torture methods --\\nthus eliminating the fear that a detainee might be released if those\\nmethods were used to extract a confession.

[emphasis mine]\".  Scholars sometimes do not even mention\\nthe two Josephus entries, another subtlety reflecting consensus.\\n\\nSo far as I can deduce, today\\'s consensus is built on at least three things: \\n1) the long passage is way out of context, 2) Origen did not know about the\\nlong passage, and 3) the short and long passages are contradictory. \\nI don\\'t know the references wherein the arguments which led to consensus are\\norginally developed (does anyone?).\\n\\nBiblical scholars as I defined them include theologians and historians.

(In turn, historians are compelled to\\nincorporate theology).\\n\\nCan\\'t say about the number of copies.  These were, however, BG times (Before \\nGutenburg).  A hundred first editions seems exceedingly high; counting on one \\nhand seems more reasonable.  Perhaps those mss. without the long insert (if any,\\nbecause anything is possible) have been destroyed.  Such a practice is \\ncertainly not foreign to religions.  Anyway, all we have are mss. which have \\nthe two entries.  Lippart (in the message noted above) talks about an Arabic \\nms.

In addition, people often request information which has\\nbeen posted time and time again.  In order to try and cut down on this, the\\nalt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following\\ntitles:\\n\\n   1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers\\n   2.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Introduction to Atheism\\n   3.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\\n   4.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument\\n   5.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Atheist Resources\\n\\nThis is article number 1.  Please read numbers 2 and 3 before posting.  The\\nothers are entirely optional.\\n\\nIf you are new to Usenet, you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup\\nnews.announce.newusers.  The articles titled \"A Primer on How to Work With\\nthe Usenet Community\", \"Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet\"\\nand \"Hints on writing style for Usenet\" are particularly relevant.  Questions\\nconcerning how news works are best asked in news.newusers.questions.\\n\\nIf you are unable to find any of the articles listed above, see the \"Finding\\nStuff\" section below.\\n\\n\\n                                   Credits\\n\\nThese files could not have been written without the assistance of the many\\nreaders of alt.atheism and alt.atheism.moderated.

Here are\\nsome suggestions on what to do if you can\\'t find them:\\n\\n1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with\\n   \"Alt.Atheism FAQ:\".\\n\\n2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.\\n\\n   If you don\\'t find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn\\'t set up\\n   correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the\\n   problem.\\n\\n3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].\\n   Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you\\'ll find the latest\\n   versions of the FAQ files there.\\n\\n   FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you\\n   need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to\\n   mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\\n\\n      send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq\\n\\n   in the body.\\n\\n4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article\\n   \"Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup\" carries a list of these\\n   sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.\\n\\n5. If you don\\'t have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu\\n   consisting of the following lines:\\n\\n      send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/faq\\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction\\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/logic\\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/resources\\n\\n5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of\\n   the following lines:\\n\\n      send atheism/faq/faq.txt\\n      send atheism/faq/logic.txt\\n      send atheism/faq/intro.txt\\n      send atheism/faq/resource.txt\\n\\n   and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.\\n   There\\'s other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are \"help\" and\\n   \"send atheism/index\".\\n\\n6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the\\n   newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this\\n   if you\\'ve tried the above methods and they\\'ve failed; it\\'s not nice to\\n   clutter the newsgroup or people\\'s mailboxes with requests for files.\\n   it\\'s better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,\\n   people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don\\'t have \\n   FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files.\\n\\n\\nmathew\\nÿ\\n',\n",

Diplomats and aid\\nworkers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.\\n\\nThe 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of\\nthe last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control\\nof Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations\\nin Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting\\nretreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the\\ndead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first\\nsuppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.\\nLater  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken\\nAzerbaijan\\'s wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000\\ndead.\\n\\nThe State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a\\n15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \"Hojali\\nDisaster\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on\\npreliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman\\nMemmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in\\nthe Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more\\nthan 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700\\ndead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman\\nof the Azeri Ministry of Defence.\\n\\nFranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International\\nRed Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of\\nAgdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque\\nfrom  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \"We  did  not count  the\\nbodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\" Mr\\nZen Ruffinen said. \"We have some idea since we gave the body bags\\nand products to wash the dead.\"\\n\\nMr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the\\nnumber of  dead in the  massacre. \"Don\\'t  get worked up.  It will\\ntake  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\" the  43-year-old\\nlawyer said at his small office.\\n\\nMr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to\\nreach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714\\nwounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist\\nuprising in Baku in January 1990.\\n\\nThose  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power\\nthree weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly\\nwhat  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70\\nmiles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.\\n\\nOfficially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being\\nthe  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the\\nrepublic\\'s forensic department. \"This  is just a small percentage\\nof the dead,\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic\\'s chief forensic\\nscientist. \"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the\\nchaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury\\nour dead within 24 hours.\"\\n\\nOf these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14\\nyears old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and\\naxes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland\\nsnows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of\\ndeliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises\\ncut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov\\'s\\nreport. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those\\nbelieved to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.\\n\\nFiles  from  Mr  Rasulov\\'s  investigative  commission  are  still\\ndisorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six\\npolicemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the\\nnames of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The\\nmost heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far\\ncomes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a\\nhelicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27\\nFebruary.\\n\\n\"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to\\ncount properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream\\nand the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\" Mr\\nManafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter\\npilot.\\n\\n\"People waved up  to us for help.

We tried to land but\\nArmenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to\\nreturn.\"\\n\\nThere  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in\\ncirculation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few\\nmonths and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali\\nat the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages\\ntaken over by Armenian forces.\\n\\nTHE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/\\'92\\n\\n\\nHEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES\\n\\nAREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the\\nCaspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in\\nhis trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of\\nHojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.\\n\\n\"I\\'m still  wearing the same  clothes, I don\\'t have  any others,\"\\nthe  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the\\nHojali disaster. \"I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to\\nbe alive.\"\\n\\nMr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity\\nfor more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12\\ndays. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the\\n2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the\\nedge of Karabakh.\\n\\n\"At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard\\nbefore,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy\\nmachine-guns, the lot,\" Mr Sadikov said.\\n\\nSoon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction\\nof  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started\\nfleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the\\nsnow into a forest on the other side.\\n\\nTo escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam\\nabout 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it,\\nuntil at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two\\nArmenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.\\n\\n\"None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by\\na  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening\\nfire,\" Mr Sadikov said.\\n\\nAzeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward\\nto force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts\\nwere mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his\\ngroup of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman\\nson.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his\\n67-year-old elder brother.\\n\\n\"I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,\"\\nhe said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. \"We\\nhave never got any of the bodies back.\"\\n\\nThe first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire.\\nOne hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he\\nstruggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group\\'s\\ncrossing, Mr Sadikov said.\\n\\nAnother hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and\\nseveral others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy\\nhillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three\\nArmenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.\\n\\nAs the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was\\nlittle comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was\\nsoon to flee.\\n\\n\"The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian\\nrocket attack. Some people just  kept going,\" Mr Sadikov said. \"I\\nhad to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way.\\nThey even found a bullet in my sock.\"\\n\\nVictims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the\\nHojali massacre in February  (left).

Muggers using a gun rely primarily on the\\nthreat of the gun, and rarely shoot their victim. A mugger\\nusing a knife is much more likely to start by stabbing his victim \\nin an effort incapacitate him. So, while a knif may not\\nbe as deadly as a gun, criminals are more likely to actually\\n_use_ the knife (as opposed to threatening the victim with it.)\\nIt isn\\'t at all clear that replacing the criminal\\'s gun with a\\nknife would reduce murders. Stabbings might just become more\\ncommon. That\\'s why it is important to look at the overall\\n(not the with-gun) homicide rate. It avoids the issue of\\nsubstitution, different criminal techinques of using different\\nweapons, etc... and measures what we want to prevent: Murders.\\n\\n>As for knives, see my earlier post.

However, facing knife-welding attackers isn\\'t\\ntoo common: Stabbing without warning and by supprise is the\\nusual tactic.

L. \\nacidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarily \\nresponsible for keeping the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free.  Most of \\nthe commercial yogurt sold in the U.S. has a very low L. acidophilus and L. \\nbulgaricus count.

Gordon R. has told \\nme through e-mail that he gives his patients L. acidophilus and several \\ndifferent obligate anaerobes(which set-up shop in the colon) but he hasn\\'t \\ntold me which ones yet.  The Lactobacillus genera are mostly facultative \\nanaerobes and will set-up shop where they have access to oxygen if given a \\nchance(mouth, anus, sinus cavity and vagina).  Having these good bacteria \\naround will greatly decrease the chance of candida blooms in the anal \\nregion or the vagina.  I have not proposed a systemic action for candida \\nblooms.  I know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise from \\nthe evil yeast blooms in the body.  I\\'m not ready to buy that yet.  I do \\nbelieve that complications at specific sites(vagina, anal and maybe lower \\ncolon, sinus and mouth) can result from antibiotic use which removes the \\ncompeting bacteria from these sites and thus lets candida grow unchecked.\\nRestoring the right bacterial balance is the best way(in my opinion) to get \\nrid of the problem.  Anti-fungals, a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin A \\nsupplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the \\ngood bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower the \\npH to basically starve the candida out.\\n\\n\\nMarty B.\\n',\n",

This makes the\\nAsante box pretty much unusable.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t look like a purely electrical SCSI problem, because if I turn\\non the drive just a second or so too late, so that it doesn\\'t get noticed\\nduring the initial SCSI polling, the Mac boots normally and the adapter\\nworks, even though the hard disk is powered on and connected.

For private\\nownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual must\\nbe able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safe\\ncondition.

If you look at the American \\nrevolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselves\\nfrom, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. They\\ndidn\\'t overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for \\nexample) that didn\\'t defend themselves were still under that same\\nold regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out and\\ndestroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate.\\nBut their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons aren\\'t suited\\nfor that.\\n\\nThere is also the question of personal and collective arms: The\\nSecond Amendment definately protects ownership of personal\\nweapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members\\nto provide their own arms.) But it isn\\'t clear if it covers\\nother arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example)\\na tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively)\\nshould. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a \\ndisproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower.\\nThe militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremely\\ndemocratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only\\n50% would respond to a muster, and the militia\\'s firepower would\\nbe proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popular\\nwill were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of the\\nmembers supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the\\nform of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militia\\'s\\nfirepower would depend on the will of a small minority, not\\nof the general public. Worse, that minority would be quite\\ndifferent from the general public (at the very least, they\\nwould be much richer.) As a result, I think the nature and\\ncharacter of the militia requires that each member provide\\na roughly equal share of the militia\\'s firepower: His personal\\nweapons, and some equitable fraction of a squad\\'s heavier firepower.\\n\\n                                                  Frank Crary\\n                                                  CU Boulder\\n\\n',\n",

Is it received, collected, read and used?\\n\\nOn these counts, the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God.\\nTo quote Unger\\'s Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha:\\n1. They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and\\nanachronisms.\\n2. They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices\\nwhich are at variance with sacred Scripture.\\n3. They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of\\nsubject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture.\\n4. They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine\\nScripture their divine character, such as prophetic power and\\npoetic and religious feeling.\\n\\n>:  \\n>:  My interim conclusion is that Protestant exclusion of \\n>:  (at least one of) these writings is one of those \\'traditions\\n>:  of men\\' one hears of so often.

The Jewish council you mentioned previously didn\\'t\\naccept them, so the reformation protestants had good historical\\nprecedence for their actions. Jerome only translated the\\napocrapha under protest, and it was literally \\'over his dead\\nbody\\' that it was included in the catholic canon.\\n\\n>The simple fact is that Protestant exclusion, Roman inclusion, Orthodox\\n>inclusion of still other books, or any other definition of a closed canon\\n>is the decision of a community of faith about what the standard collection\\n>of scripture shall be for that community.

I have been observing that 'Poly' has been practicing \\nGoebels' rule quite loyally. 'Poly's audience is mostly made of Greeks \\nwho are not allowed to listen to Turkish news. However, in today's \\ninformed world Greek propagandists can only fool themselves. For \\ninstance, those who lived in 1974 will remember the TV news they \\nwatched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can \\nread the American newspapers of July and August 1974 to find out what \\nreally happened. \\n\\nThere are in Turkiye the Greek Hospital, The Greek Girls' Lycee \\nAlumni Association, the Principo Islands Greek Benevolent Society, \\nthe Greek Medical Foundation, the Principo Greek Orphanage Foundation, \\nthe Yovakimion Greek Girls' Lycee Foundation, and the Fener Greek \\nMen's Lycee Foundation.  \\n\\nAs for Greece, the longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish' \\nin titles and on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts \\nhave ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association, \\nthe Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti \\nTurkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks\\nin Western Thrace. Such community associations had been \\nactive until 1984. But they were first told to remove\\nthe word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official\\npapers and then eventually close down. This is also the \\nfinal verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court.\\n\\nIn the city of Komotini, a former Greek Parliamentarian of Turkish\\nparentage, was sentenced recently to 18 months of imprisonment\\nwith no right to appeal, just for saying outloud that he was\\nof Turkish descent. This duly-elected ethnic Turkish official\\nwas also deprived of his political rights for a period of three \\nyears. Each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than \\na vehicle, used by the Greek governments, to cover-up their inferiority \\ncomplex they display, vis-a-vis, the people of Turkiye. \\n\\nThe Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks,' \\nwhich demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference \\nto 'Muslims.' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the \\nexistence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the \\nessential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger \\nTurkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people, whom all the \\nthree nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of \\nthemselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized \\naccording to the agreements? Poor 'Poly.'\\n\\nIt also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece \\nand the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world.\\nThe Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish\\nminority. They pursue the same denial in connection with \\nthe Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition,\\nin 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091,\\nvirtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and\\nother charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting\\nreligious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek \\ngovernments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective\\nof the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although\\nthe Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in\\nGreece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing\\nits religious leaders. Talk about democracy.\\n\\nThe government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic \\nconvention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an \\nattitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a \\nviolation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called' \\nGreek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection \\nof historical monuments. \\n\\nThe government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new \\nchurches in remote villages as a complementary step toward \\nHellenizing the region.\\n\\nAnd you pondered. Sidiropoulos, the president of the Macedonian Human \\nRights Committee, became the latest victim of a tactic long used by \\nthe Greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation \\nof the Macedonian minority. A forestry official by occupation, \\nSidiropoulos has been sent to 'internal exile' on the island of \\nKefalonia, hundreds of kilometers away from his native Florina. \\nHis employer, the Florina City Council, asked him to depart in \\n24 hours. The Greek authorities are trying to punish him for his \\ninvolvement in Copenhagen. He returned to Florina by his own choice \\nand remains without a job. \\n\\nHelsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating \\nthe plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their \\nfindings were published in a report titled \\n\\n 'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.'\\n\\nThe report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the \\nTurkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance, \\nthe Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in \\nKomotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against \\nthe Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the \\nLausanne Convention. \\n\\nThe Turkish cemeteries in the village of Vafeika and in Pinarlik\\nwere attacked, and tombstones were broken.

Meanwhile, Greek \\nand Greek Cypriot officials are reported to have planned \\nto take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the \\ntransfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern \\nCyprus, a process that will conflict with the spirit of \\nthe agreement on conventional arms reduction in Europe.\\n\\nAn acceptable method may certainly be found when there\\nis a will. But we know of various kinds of violent\\nbehaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burning\\nof buildings.

It\\'s personal this time (and every time I post -- see the\\nsignature).\\n\\nDue to demand and requests, here are some additional DMQS files I\\'ve\\ncollected for the XGA-2.  These files function with the latest revision\\nof the drivers for the XGA-2.  Not all these files will work under Windows\\nwith the drivers available to the general public at this time.

They represent a personal collection, not\\nanything resembling an officially supported set.\\n\\nAs a standard disclaimer I would like to point out the following facts:\\n1) Some of these files may run your adapter out of spec.  Doing so can\\n   stress the ICs on the card and may result in incorrect operation or in\\n   shorter life (how short depends on how much out of spec [boom!] :-).\\n2) Some of these files may run your adapter in a region that is out of\\n   spec for your monitor, resulting in damage to your monitor.\\n3) You should be knowledgable about your monitor and adapter\\'s ability\\n   to use the mode you select.  Using these files represents hacking\\n   in a very true sense, so practice safe computing and don\\'t play\\n   around too much if you don\\'t like the risks and aren\\'t knowledgable\\n   about what you\\'re doing.\\n4) If you feel uncomfortable with all the warnings, use the DMQS files\\n   you have or wait until IBM releases official, tested DMQS files.\\n   Although you should be aware of warning 2) even with the IBM files.\\n\\nTHESE FILES ARE UNSUPPORTED!  By using them you may invalidate your\\nwarrenty.  Not all have been fully tested -- I don\\'t have that many\\nmonitors.\\n\\nInstallation: unpack in your DMQSPATH environment variable, usually\\nc:\\\\xga$dmqs.  Then use the methods described in your XGA-2 installation\\ndiskette to change your adapter or settings.\\n\\nPacking: these files have been packed with the latest INFOZIP utility.  \\nYou will need PKZip 2.x if you don\\'t have the INFOZIP utilities.\\n\\nSubmitting:  feel free to send me uuencoded versions of your favorite DMQS\\nfiles for your favorite monitors.

ABout\\na year ago I found that the master cylinder on the clutch in the '84 was        \\nleaking fluid around the piston seal, leading to air in the system and fluid\\nback into the passenger compartment of the car.  I pulled the plunger and\\ngot a rebuild kit (new plunger, seal, etc.) and thought I had the problem\\nlicked.  Much to my surprise, the same problem developed several months\\nlater!  This time I looked carefully at the master cylinder to make sure\\nthere were no scratches, burrs, or other obvious causes of the problem.  I\\ndidn't find any.  Ever since I have been periodically feeding the clutch\\nhydraulins additional fluid and bleeding air from the system.  I knew I\\nwould be selling the car and didn't want to go all the way to solving the\\nproblem.\\n\\nI should add that the clutch is original, and that I've had to adjust the\\npedal to allow maximum extension of the piston into the master cylinder in\\norder to actuate the clutch.\\n\\nMy hypothesis is that this means that when fully depressing the clutch pedal,\\nthe angle of the piston rod (attached to the pedal) is off the axix of the\\ncylinder, thus cocking the piston and seal and perhaps deforming it.\\n\\nWhat do you think of that as an explanation?  Can you suggest a possible fix\\nshort of replacing the master cylinder and getting a new clutch put in?\\n\\nNow the '86: same problem, except that the above diagnosis doesn't explain\\nwhy all of the fluid leaked out (by way of the master cylinder, into the\\npassenger compartment) while I was on vacation for 10 days, during which\\nthe clutch pedal was not depressed or otherwise caused to distort.  What\\ncan you suggest here?\\n\\nMany thanks.  Let's hope I don't end up going to Click and Clack on this...\\n\\nBill Christens-Barry\\ncerulean@access.digex.com\\n\\n\",\n",

Rudolf Frieling elaborates this in detail in his \\n\"Christianity and Reincarnation\".  The thrust of the passage\\nin its context is to liken the one time incarnation and \\nsacrifice of Christ for all mankind to the individual \\nexperience of the human being after death.  The \"once\" \\nis repeated and emphasized, and it highlights the singularity \\nof Christ\\'s deed.  One thing for certain it does is to \\nrefute the claims of some that Christ incarnates more than \\nonce.  But the comparison to the human experience - die \\nonce, then judgement (note: not \"the judgement\", but just \\n\"judgement\".  The word for judgement is \"krisis\".\\n\\nHebrews 9:27 is the one passage most often quoted in defense\\nof the doctrine that the Bible denies reincarnation.  At this\\npoint, I would just emphasize again that the  passages \\nthat (arguably) speak against it are few, and that invariably\\nthey are talking about something eles, and the apparent denial\\nof reincarnation is either inferred, or, as in the case of\\nHebrews, taken literally and deposited into an implied context,\\nnamely a doctrine of the destiny of the human being after\\ndeath.\\n\\nWhat should be considered seriously is that the Bible is essentially\\nsilent about the fate of the individual human being between death\\nand the Last Day.  If you take the few passages that could possibly\\nbe interpreted to mean a single earth life, they are arguable.  And\\nthere are other passages that point, arguably, in the other direc-\\ntion. such as Matthew 11:14 and John 9:2.\\n\\nWe can continue to debate the individual scraps of scripture that\\nmight have a bearinig on this, and indeed we should discuss them.\\nBut what I wanted to introduce into the discussion was an approach\\nto the idea of repeated earth lives that, unlike Hindu, Buddhist\\nand \"new age\" teachings, takes full cognizance of the divinity, singular\\nincarnation, death, burial, resurrection, and second coming of Christ\\nas the savior of mankind; the accountability of each individual for\\nhis deeds and the reality of the Fall and of sin and its consequences;\\nthe redemption of man from sin through Christ; the resurrection of\\nthe body, and the Last Judgement.\\n\\nTaken in this larger sense, many serious questions take on an entirely\\ndifferent perspective.  E.g. the destiny of those who died in their\\nsins before Christ came. the relationship of faith and grace to \\nworks, the meaning of \"deathbed conversion\", the meaning of the\\nsacraments, and many other things.  Not that I propose to answer all\\nthose questions by a simple doctrine of convenience, but only that\\nthe discussion takes on a different dimension, and in my opinion\\none that is truly worthy of both man, the earth, and their Creator and \\nRedeemer. There are many deep questions that continue to be deep, such \\nas the meaning of the second death, and how the whole of Christian\\ndoctrine would apply to this larger perspective of human existence.\\n\\nThere are those who deeply believe that the things of which the Bible \\ndoes not speak are not things we should be concerned with.  But Christ\\nalso indicated that there were other things that we would come to know\\nin the future, including things that his disciples (and therefore others) \\ncould not bear yet.  This idea that the human capacity for growth in\\nknowledge, not only of the individual in one lifetime, but of the whole\\nof humanity, also takes on great meaning when we realize that our growth\\nin the spirit is a long term process.  The Bible was not meant to codify\\nall spiritual knowledge in one place forever, but to proclaim the gospel\\nof the incarnation and redeeming deed of Christ - taking the gospel in the\\ngreater context, from Genesis to Revelation.  Now, salvation (healing) becomes, \\nnot the end of man\\'s sojourn but its beginning.  And the Last Judgement and\\nthe New Heaven and Earth that follow it become its fulfullment.\\n\\nGerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)\\n',\n",

Other than government land, saved for posterity and the eco-system\\nas well as government function, the remaining land is owned by a smaller\\npercentage of the people than ever before. The game of capitalism is almost\\nwon. The game has only to be declared over and we will have to take matters\\ninto our own hands and redistribute it again fairly, or else be enslaved in\\nreturn for a place to live. Here in central California, already, fewer than\\n30% own all the property and 5% of them own 90% of it. That\\'s twice what it\\nwas twenty years ago. Rents are so high that you pay 60% of your income for\\nrent. If you just have a McJob, all you can afford is one room, if that.\\nSome 30% of minimum wage workers are homeless. Unless you both have degrees\\nin technical fields and are working in them, (in the midst of 30%\\nunemployment in high tech jobs!), you will never own anything but a used\\ncar if you choose to have more than one child!!! And everywhere else you\\ncould afford there are no jobs. The only way to get there is to save and\\nnot consume any more than you have to, clothing used, food poor.

Extra is kept for\\nthe future. You get to stay where you are without paying rent. Land that\\nsupports others becomes property of the state. Farmers are welcome to plant\\ncrops that people need according to demand and ability and soil quality. If\\nyou want to grow sourgum because you always did, and you aren\\'t doing a\\ngood job, then we let another farmer grow sorghum, and you grow something\\nelse. When people die the land they were entitled to use goes into the\\npublic holdings. No one can sell land, but they can trade places with\\nanybody. No one can lease land. The government will locally distribute the\\nuse of the land not used for residences. Residences that are insufficient\\nto the families living there can be traded to the public for a larger house\\nand yard according to need and availability. The local land council who vow\\nto live on their land till death to avoid profit ties will decide fairness\\nsubject to review by the state and federal land councils. It will cost no\\nmore than any fucking thing costs now with fucking assed rent going down a\\ndeep dark hole to the owners! Anyone can submit a request for a larger\\nhouse or land to start a business on, depending on a valid business plan\\nand community needs. Heavy equipment is subject to seizure for the public\\ngood or as needed. Heavy equipment operators are encouraged to keep and\\nmaintain their own machine and to operate it at a reasonable salary in\\nservice to the community. Companies who own many machines are to be divided\\namong the appropriate equipment operators and the rest to be let to valid\\noperators on a need basis. Cost of upkeep is charged. A guild of heavy\\nmachine operators is recognized for safety and training\\'s sake. Their\\ncouncil is a subcouncil to the community council. Etc. Etc. Etc. It isn\\'t\\nso hard to think of a better system than we have. All you have to do is\\nrealize that the system we have now is not sacrosanct, in fact it\\'s a\\nrigged game that steals you blind and is the most unfair any system could\\nbe already!!!!!!!! The trick is to realize that the old rich have been\\nmaking the rules behind your back and that it\\'s time to kick them off the\\nmerry-go-round. Tax the rich to death. They are the ones that converted\\nyour 60\\'s school lunch program into the joke it is today. They are the ones\\nwho always cut education. They are the ones who always raise the rent when\\nyou get a raise. They are the ones who should be not just dislodged but\\nkilled for their abuse. I have trouble justifying the death penalty for a\\npoor kid who killed and didn\\'t know why not. I have no trouble justifying\\nthe death penalty for the rich who steal countless human lives to feed\\ntheir greed! Have you paid rent most of your life? Then you have been\\nenslaved, percentage wise, most of your life. We used to be serfs. Now we\\nare called renters, and we are still enslaved to somebody who claims to own\\nland they don\\'t use and make us pay them for it when they did nothing to\\nown it. Most rents in California are enough to buy the apartment house,\\npaynthe taxes and the insurance and have a little left over to travel with!\\nI have seen the books!

And her child will have the money to likewise\\nenslave my child. I hope I find out when I am going to die. I can make\\nthings just a little happier form me to be able to destroy her life as she\\ndestroyed mine. And maybe I can take a few other landlords with me, and\\ntheir heirs.

It just might be a bad idea for them, too.\\n\\nOK, suppose the NY State Police want to tap a suspect\\'s phone.  They\\nneed a warrant, just like the old days.  But unlike the old days, they\\nnow need to \\n\\n   (a) get two federal agencies to give them the two parts of\\n       the key.\\n\\nNow, what happens if there\\'s a tiff between the two escrow houses?\\nPosession/release of keys becomes a political bargaining chit.  State\\nand lower-level police agencies have to watch the big boys play politics,\\nwhile potentially good leads disappear, lives and property are lost,\\nstatutes of limitations run out, etc.  Not to mention: a moderately\\nclever person who suspects the police are after her/him will be buying\\nnew phones faster than tap requests can be processed.  Or using stolen\\nones.  [Will the Turing Police come and arrest you for transmitting\\nwithout a dialing license?]\\n\\nThere\\'s also bureacracy and security problems -- within each escrow house, \\nhow will requests for key disclosure be authenticated?  Put in enough\\nsafeguards of the kind bureaucrats and activists feel comfortable with, and \\nit might take a LONG time to get that key.  [Even when a request is approved, \\nhow is the key going to be disclosed?  Will it be encrypted by a Clipper-type\\nchip for transmission?  In a bureaucracy the size of the Federal\\nGovernment, with a databank of the necessary size, and data traffic of\\nthe projected volume, there\\'s going to be a lot of weak links.  How many of \\nthese kinds of problems will be open for public or \"expert\" scrutiny?]  \\n\\nFurthermore, the Feds might be leery of handing completed keys around, \\neven to State Police agencies: a trust and security issue.  This would be \\nan especially acute issue if some other State\\'s Police had mishandled a \\nkey, resulting in lawsuits, financial settlements, and political \\nembarassment.  So, the Feds implement it this way:\\n \\n   (b) some federal agency gets the keys, performs the tap, and\\n       turns the results over to the NY State Police.\\n\\nBut let\\'s say Cuomo\\'s been causing some problems over a Clinton\\nAid-To-Urban-Areas proposal.  Or there just happens to be a turf war\\ngoing on between the State cops and the Justice department on a case.\\nNow, not only do we have the keys as a political chit, we have an\\nextra player in the game *and* we have the tap\\'s tapes as another\\nbargaining chit.

The first case would happen \\n  if no western intervention happened, and the second case was a direct \\n  or indirect result of western envolvement. \\n\\nPossibly, if 200,000 Iraqis had indeed died, but this number is based on\\nGreenpeace estimates.  Greenpeace had compromised its alleged\\nimpartiality during the war by condemning the potential environmental\\nconsequences of Allied miiltary action, while initially *completely*\\nignoring Iraq\\'s horrible environmental crimes, starting with the dumping\\nof millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf at Ahmadi to the blowing of\\nover 700 oil wells.  What is the real number?  There has been a lot of\\nwork on this in the last two years, none of it reported as the\\nGreenpeace figure seems to get continuously bandied about.  The real\\nnumber seems to be around 10,000, on the same order as the number of\\nKuwaitis killed, tortured and kidnapped during the occupation.

Independent Television News reported a figure around 15,000 only\\na few months after the war, but it was hardly reported. \\n\\nFor the Allies to have killed 200,000 Iraqis, they would have had to\\nkill twice the *total* number of Iraqis in Kuwait. \\n\\nThe favored image of the hysterics is the last battle of the war at\\nMutla\\'.  This was yet another example of the American and European media\\nplaying into the hands of Iraq and its de facto allies.     The\\ndestruction of the Iraqi convoy at Mutla\\' was portrayed as an all-out\\nslaughter.  This is simply not true.

All rights reserved. \\n\\nBy NICK LUDINGTON \\n Associated Press Writer \\n   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After the Persian Gulf War ended, the world was\\ntold that \\nas many as 100,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed. At one point, even Baghdad put \\nthe toll that high, as did the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency in private. \\n   But U.S. officials have been backpedaling ever since, even though the \\nPentagon has yet to settle on an official estimate to release to the public. \\nNow, one former DIA analyst says the number of Iraqi troops killed may\\nhave been \\nas low as 1,500. \\n   That conclusion by John Heidenrich, writing in the current issue of the \\nquarterly magazine Foreign Policy, represents the lowest estimate yet\\nfrom U.S. \\ndefense sources. \\n   The revisions suggesting a less devastating Iraqi toll fit a pattern of \\nvastly moderated U.S. military claims in the months after the war ended.\\nClaims \\nfor a number of U.S. weapons also were scaled down. \\n   Despite the dramatic videotapes of successful weaponry or the shocking \\npictures of Iraq\\'s disastrous retreat from Kuwait, arguments have continued \\nunabated about what really happened in the Gulf War. \\n   Heidenrich is not the first to question the Iraqi death toll numbers that \\noriginally were aired. More that a year ago, Air Force Lt. Gen. Charles\\nHorner, \\nthe commander of the air campaign in the Gulf War, said he believed the Iraqi \\nmilitary death toll was fewer than 10,000 for the entire war. \\n   The Pentagon itself still refuses to provide an estimate of the number of \\nIraqis who died in the 42-day war against the U.S.-led coalition in\\nJanuary and \\nFebruary 1991. On Monday, Pentagon spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Joe Gradisher\\nreiterated \\npast statements that \"there just isn\\'t a number,\" that is credible. \\n   But some current internal estimates range from 8,000 to 25,000 Iraqi troops \\nkilled, said one analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity, who is familiar \\nwith the Pentagon\\'s reports. \\n   Allied deaths were put at 146 Americans, 35 by friendly fire; 24 British, 9 \\nby American fire; 2 Frenchmen, 1 Italian and 39 among various Arab allies. \\n   Of the postwar reassessments, the most widely publicized was the Army\\'s \\nreluctant acknowledgement, months later, that its touted Patriot air defense \\nsystem was nowhere near so effective as claimed against Iraq\\'s Scud missiles. \\nThe Bush administration initially claimed an almost perfect record for the \\nPatriot; last spring it revised the hit ratio to 60 percent. \\n   The success record of the Navy\\'s Tomahawk high-tech cruise missile used \\nagainst targets in Baghdad and other parts of Iraq also turned out to be more \\nmodest than initially indicated by the Pentagon. \\n   The first Iraqi casualty figures to surface after the war came in a\\nMay 1991 \\nreport by the environmental group Greenpeace, which said 100,000 to 120,000 \\nIraqi soldiers were killed. It estimated that 5,000 to 15,000 Iraqi civilians \\nwere also killed. \\n   The same month, published reports said the Defense Intelligence Agency \\nestimated 100,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed and 300,000 wounded in the\\nair and \\nground campaigns -- although the agency qualified that by saying the estimate \\ncould be off by as much as 50 percent in either direction. \\n   But as more information became available, those figures gradually were \\nrevised downward. \\n   The House Armed Services Committee staff estimated 9,000 dead and 17,000 \\nwounded after a review last year. \\n   But Heidenrich, writing in the current issue of the quarterly Foreign\\nPolicy, \\nestimated the total death toll from both the air and ground offensives\\nas low as \\n1,500 -- with about 3,000 wounded. \\n   Heidenrich based the conclusion in his article on the number of\\nbodies found \\nand buried by U.S. troops -- 577 -- and on prisoner of war interviews.\\nHe noted \\nthat only about 2,000 of 69,000 Iraqi prisoners of war were wounded. \\n   Based on the calculation that about half as many wounded escaped as were \\ncaptured, he put the number of wounded at about 3,000. Using a conservative \\nratio of one dead to two wounded, applicable to Third World armies like\\nIraq, he \\nset battlefield deaths at 1,500. \\n   \"Maybe the figures are too low,\" he wrote. \"Maybe the real death toll\\non the \\nbattlefield was 2,000 or 3,000 or even 6,000. Even then, the evidence\\nsuggests a \\ndeath toll of well below 100,000 -- or even 10,000.\" \\n   In an interview, he said the 100,000 figure was obviously off base\\nbecause it \\nwould mean that virtually all the Iraqi soldiers in the Kuwait theater of \\noperations were casualties. \\n   He said today\\'s bloodiest wars were not those fought with high technology, \\nbut rather the drawn-out conflicts such as those in Yugoslavia and Somalia. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n',\n",

The Jets\\nlooked more dangerous in this one but it didn't make a difference in the \\nnumbers that counted: goals.\\n\\tVancouver's big line produced again, with centre Cliff Ronning and\\nleft winger Geoff Courtnall scoring in the first and in the second to \\nboost the Canucks to a 2-0 lead on giveaways by the suspect Jet defence of\\nBautin and Ulanov. Mental lapses by the defence and goal-scoring talent\\nin opportune areas made the difference in all three Canuck goals.\\n\\tHowever, as in the first game, the Jets worked hard to take the\\ngame to the Canucks in the second period. The Jets dominated the second,\\nchecking hard and penetrating the Vancouver zone without being challenged\\nby a Canuck team that wanted to pack it in early. \\n\\tThe hard work paid off late in the second, when Tie Domi caught\\nVancouver goalie Kirk McLean by surprise with a sharp angle shot to make\\nthe score 2-1. \\n\\tDomi's goal gave the Jets new life as they began to take the rush\\nto the Canuck's collapsing defence. The Canucks were unwilling to do \\nanything but let McLean take shots and clear the rebounds. The Jets were\\nallowed to set up and make plays.\\n\\tBoth goalies made standup saves as the play picked up considerably.\\nMcLean made three great saves in the second off a dancing Teammu Selanne\\nwhile Essensa was rocked by a Pavel Bure drive. Selanne looked dangerous\\non the rush as the Jets pressed a series of attacks into the Canuck\\nzone. The Canucks, on the other hand, looked like they were offering four\\nchecking lines in an effort to preserve their slim lead.\\n\\tA series of minor penalties at the end of the second period\\nresulted in a one man advantage for the Jets in the early third. The\\nJet's Tempo Numminen drove a puck from the point through McLean's\\nlegs and into the net to tie the game at 2-2.\\n\\tThe Canuck's discordant play picked up where it left off.\\nThis was characterized by long lead passes that either never connected\\nor were picked off by the Jets and individual rushes into a tight\\nWinnipeg defence that were never supported.\\n\\tHowever, as in the first and second Canuck goals, a Jet defensive\\nlapse (re: bonehead play) stalled the Winnipeg comeback. With the faceoff\\nin the Winnipeg zone, Pavel Bure was left to stand in the crease with\\nno Jet defender anywhere near him. Bure, who had been invisible in the\\ngame up to that point, took a rebound and managed to roof it with a \\nbackhand even though he was off balance. \\n\\tBy then it was too late for the Jets to come back. Essensa made it\\nto the bench with one minute to go but the extra attacker did nothing\\nfor their attack.

I am shocked at the Clinton regimes increasing lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life.\\n \\nIt is apparent to me that those who drafted the \"Clipper Chip Proposal\" (which is, incidentally, gaining notoriety as the \"Big Brother Proposal\") are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed.  Anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm, especially one destined for standardization, is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors.  The proper evaluation of an algorithm dep\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nends on careful scrutiny by these sectors, and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm.  The assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from \"experts\" without full disclosure is plain ignorance.\\n \\nIn addition, the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology, such as DES, when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy.  It seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will prefer to purchase equipment not crippled by government key escrow, no matter how \"tamper proof\" the key escrows might be.\\n \\nI cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker would have failed to realize these flaws.  I can only assume then that the drafters of the \"Clipper Chip Proposal\" knew very well the difficulties of selling a crippled system to the private sector.  The only way this proposal makes any sense, or has any chance of succeeding is in coercion.  Even the language of the proposal makes it painfully clear that the next logical step is the outlawing of other encryption devices and hardware that do not uti\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nlize the \"Big Brother Chip.\"\\n \\nUnfortunately the public at large is not educated enough on the issue to realize what they are losing.  I expect the Big Brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the American people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty words like \"harmony,\" \"right to encryption,\" and \"voluntary.\"\\n \\nIt mortifies me that the phrase that seems to be used more and more often to characterize the Clinton administration is \"I can\\'t believe it\\'s happening here.\"  More startling is a question a colleague of mine posed and the realization that everyday it becomes more and more relevant; \"When is the Reichstag fire planned for?\"\\n \\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMost Concerned,\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t[Signature]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tShaen Logan Bernhardt I\\nuni@acs.bu.edu\\n\\n-- \\nuni@acs.bu.edu  ->  Public Keys by finger and/or request\\nPublic Key Archives at <pgp-public-keys@junkbox.cc.iastate.edu>\\nDF610670F2467B99  97DE2B5C3749148C  Sovereignty is the sign of a brutal past.\\nCryptography is not a crime.

I\\nhave turned down writing recommendations for some students\\nbecause I did not know them well enough to make any meaningful\\ncomments, and some because I honestly could not recommend them\\nat that point.  \\n\\nRewrite your personal statement; take it by an English\\nprofessor or some other friendly person with skill and\\nexperience in writing and proof-reading and get their\\ncriticism, both about what you are saying as well as how you\\nsay it.\\n\\nReview your academic accomplishments.  If your grades are poor\\nin some area, don't be afraid to spend some time in further\\ncoursework.  Evidence of determined committment will help\\nhere.  If you filled your pre-medicine curriculum with gut\\ncourses, it usually shows.\\n\\nLook at your extracurricular involvements.  Participating in\\nlocal philanthropic or service organizations is a plus;\\nsubstantial leadership roles in an organization help also.\\nBeware of 'resume padding'; such things are not difficult to\\nspot and weed out.\\n\\nOverall, a clear conception of where you wish to head and why\\nyou want to get there, combined with an honest self-appraisal\\nof skills and aptitude, will be the best path to take in\\napplying to any program, medical or what-have-you.\\n\\nGood luck with the process -- as Tom Petty says, 'the waiting\\nis the hardest part', at least emotionally. :)\\n\\nBob Schmieg\\n\",\n",

Typing a <RET> while\\nthe Tektronics-mode Xterm (future reference to this will be \"Tek-term\") is\\nactive makes the Xterm read future keystrokes but does not shift input focus\\nto the Xterm (I\\'m basing that statement on the fact that the border of the \\nTek-term stays the highlighted color and that the Tek-term stays on top of\\nXterm.

Hawking, whose theories attempt to\\nexplain the origin of distant galaxies, black holes and alternate\\ndimensions, wanted to re-visit JPL, he explained, \"because while\\nI\\'m most interested in those things in space that are farther\\naway, I know that here is where the first steps are taken.\"\\n     Hawking, who was accompanied by his family, two graduate\\nstudents and his aides, began the tour in von Karman Auditorium,\\nas David Evans, deputy assistant Lab director in the Office of\\nFlight Projects, and Dr. Arden Albee, Mars Observer\\'s project\\nscientist, briefed him on current and past flight projects.\\n     Voyager was pointed out to him, with special attention paid\\nto a gold plate with a series of engraved images. Should\\nextraterrestrial life stumble upon the spacecraft, Evans noted,\\nthey would find a variety of images that would explain something\\nof Earth. The professor asked if we were still communicating with\\nthe spacecraft, and Evans affirmed that we are.\\n     Using a model of Mars Observer, Albee spent several minutes\\ndescribing the project and the spacecraft\\'s features. In answer\\nto a question from Hawking, Chahine described a proposed\\ndrag-free satellite, but confirmed that at this point, \"it\\'s only\\na concept.\" Chahine, who had met Hawking at Caltech about five\\nyears before, described the professor as \"a living miracle of the\\npower of the brain. He\\'s miraculous, and he has such a good sense\\nof humor.\"\\n     The next stop, a demonstration on scientific data\\nvisualization in Section 384\\'s Digital Image Animation Lab,\\nentertained and delighted the group, as everyone donned goggles\\nto view 3-D images of Mars. Project Scientist Dr. Eric De Jong\\nshowed off the latest data -- a comet that had only recently been\\ndiscovered in orbit close to Jupiter. Hawking was curious about\\nits composition, and as he was shown how images are developed, he\\nasked several questions on their interpretation.\\n     Norman Haynes, ALD, Office of Telecommunications and Data\\nAcquisition, briefed the professor on the Space Flight Operations\\nFacility, and then Hawking spoke with Stone.\\n     The day ended with two technical discussions of particular\\ninterest to the professor. Technical Group Leader Dr. Frank\\nEstabrook and Senior Research Scientist Hugo Wahlquist described\\na three-spacecraft gravity wave experiment, currently under way.\\nThen planetary astronomer Dr. Richard Terrile explained the\\nphilosophy and plans for extra solar system planetary detection.\\n     The Hawking party, which had been visiting Southern\\nCalifornia for five weeks, was headquartered at Caltech, and\\nplanned to leave for England within a few weeks after the Lab\\ntour.

Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains in\\nany ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a reference\\npower, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which\\nshould also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohms\\nin an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted\\nnotation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance of\\nthe circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude*\\n(rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted\\nreference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB.\\nSo. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notation\\nsuch as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.\\n\\nFor power:\\n\\n  dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )\\n\\nFor amplitude\\n\\n  dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )\\n\\n'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base\\n10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel.\\nIt has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for\\nthe common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notation\\nconvention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.\\n\\nCommon references for audio are:\\n\\n\\t0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms\\n\\t0 dBV = 1 volt\\n\\n\\t0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level)\\n\\t0 VU = -10dBV\\t(consumer gear line level)\\n\\n\\nOften times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned using\\nthe rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is all\\ndone to whatever reference is reasonable for the application\\nor moment.\\n\\nNote that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linear\\nimpedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, the\\npower will also increase the same amount. This proof can be done\\nwith the above two identities and ohm's law.\\n\\n-- \\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n       Dave Medin\\t\\t\\tPhone:\\t(205) 730-3169 (w)\\n    SSD--Networking\\t\\t\\t\\t(205) 837-1174 (h)\\n    Intergraph Corp.\\n       M/S GD3004 \\t\\tInternet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\\n  Huntsville, AL 35894\\t\\tUUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\\n\\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******\\n\\n * The opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)\\n\",\n",

That helps\\n  people judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words,\\n  \"bullshit filters\".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.\\n  \\nLater in the same post:\\n     Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building\\n  were burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and\\n  am inclined to believe an old sarge or two.\\n\\nFine, *now* you are stating that you believe their claims (or that you are\\n\"inclined\" to.  See below for a stronger statement of your beliefs).  Those\\nclaims are still ludicrous, however.\\n\\nPreviously Awesley had written:\\n  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.\\n\\nPrompting me to write:\\n  To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion\\n  grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be\\n  perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn\\'t you, since\\n  it makes your other claim seem more plausible.\\n\\nTo which Awesley replied:\\n  John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you\\'re losing it so you\\n  have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said\\n  nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you\\n  need some help, let me know and I\\'l take your side of this for a\\n  while.  You\\'re not scoring here, you\\'re boring here.\\n\\nBut why did you mention grenade launchers at all?  Because it supports the\\nnotion that the tanks shelled buildings.  And it supports that notion\\nbecause it conjures images of troops launching fragmentary grenades.  But\\nthat too is ludicrous.\\n\\nI wrote:\\n  If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been\\n  screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about\\n  it. \\n\\nAwesley relied:\\n     Glad to know you\\'re such an expert.  Nice to hear some an\\n  authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it\\n  had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an\\n  authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged\\n  massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.\\n  Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but\\n  the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was \"several\".  I\\'ve also\\n  heard some things about that but I won\\'t dare repeat them.  You\\'d\\n  assert that I claimed they were truth.\\n\\nYes, if it happened I would have heard about it.  Everybody would have. \\nArmy tanks don\\'t fire their cannons in American cities in the 1960\\'s\\nwithout it becoming common knowledge, without minority leaders seizing on\\nit and condemning it over and over again, without civil libertarians saying\\n\"this has gone far enough.\"  So, yes, my never hearing of it was the basis\\nfor my disbelieving the claim.  Now I have more reasons to disbelieve it. \\nNot one poster has written to say, yes, I lived in Detroit at that time and\\neverybody knew that the tanks had fired shells.  This is the UseNet.  If it\\nhad happened, somebody here would remember it.  Furthermore, your own\\nresearch failed to come up with any support for the claim.  The claim is\\nextraordinary and it has no supporting evidence, extraordinary or not. \\nUnless you count the brags of a couple of guardsmen shooting the shit.  I\\ndo not.\\n\\nI wrote:\\n  Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. \\n\\nAwesley wrote:\\n     Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the \\n  difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26 \\n  years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks.\\n  So it would have been an Army cover-up.\\n\\nQuibble.  Fine, it was an Army cover-up.  Six years in the Reserves has\\ntaught me the difference also.  But do you think that in two and half\\ndecades not one guilt-ridden participant has come forward and said \"yes, I\\nshelled Americans,\" or \"I gave the orders to fire the cannons,\" or \"I\\nhelped cover it up\"?\\n\\nI wrote:\\n  If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I\\nprefer\\n  to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that\\n  those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.\\n\\nAwesley replied:\\n    Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I\\'m quite willing to believe\\n  that they did fire their guns.\\n\\nGood.  Then we can drop the junk about you not claiming that they did. \\nYour belief fails a basic reality check: why isn\\'t it known?\\n\\nAwesley concludes:\\n     Now then, we\\'ve bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read\\n  this far and all you\\'ve managed to say is that you don\\'t believe the\\n  account I cited.\\n\\nActually, now we have established that I don\\'t believe what you believe, as\\nwell as why I don\\'t believe it.

I\\'ve weathered attempted dog attacks before using the\\napproved method: Slow down to screw up dog\\'s triangulation of target,\\nthen take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it\\ndidn\\'t work because I didn\\'t have time. Riding up the hill leading to my\\nhouse, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to\\nthe Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to\\nthe Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to\\nharm.\\n\\nBut I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the\\nroughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph\\nfor the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the\\nleft side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he\\nhad been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away,\\nheading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I\\nsaw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took\\nthe dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was\\ndriven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent\\nmarks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think\\nI saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this\\nmoment is hazy.\\n\\nI next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The\\napologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut\\nmouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my\\nshin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not.\\nSo I\\'m left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!\\n\\nInterestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never\\nmoved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike\\noff course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some\\ngut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me\\nhere, as I didn\\'t feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.\\n\\nWhat worries me about the accident is this: I don\\'t think I could have\\nprevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not\\nnecessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was\\nriding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if\\nit had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the\\nthought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a\\nblind driveway at 15-30 mph.

The first two games,\\nespecially Elvira II: Jaws of Cerberus made it very tough to\\nstay alive and hit-point restoring was very difficult.  This \\nis not to say that Waxworks is a walk in the park, but it is\\nquite fair, in that there is always some weapon to be found\\nthat is quite effective, or hint given as to the proper fighting\\nstrategy.  In one of the four wax works to be explored, there is \\nno fighting at all (well almost none), though all four contain\\nmoderately challanging puzzles.\\n\\nThe really interesting thing about this game is that it is really \\nbroken up into four seperate RPGs, one for each of the four exhibits\\nyou must enter.

One exhibits traps\\nyou inside a multi-level ancient Egyptian pyramid which you must \\nescape by fighting, mapping and puzzle solving.  Another exhibit\\ntraps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines\\nand pods, while the local humans have been transformed into plant\\nzombies.  This is a single level maze that requires you to rescue\\nsome humans, kill the head plant alien, and figuere out how to kill\\nthe very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up.  This is\\nperhaps the most horrifying exhibit.  Another exhibit puts you into\\nJack The Ripper England where you appear by the corpse of a fresh Ripper\\nvictim, and of course the police think you are responsible.  You must\\navoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of The Ripper and \\nmeet him face to face - but first get a disquise.  The last exhibit\\npus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to \\nstop the almost indestructible zombies.  \\n\\nOver all the VGA graphics and music are very effective in setting a \\ncreepy tone for the game, as was the case for the Elvira games, though\\ngameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game.\\nI heartily recommend it for RPG and Horror fans.   \\n\\n*********************************************************\\n\\n- All prices include shipping.\\n- All games are in excellent condition unless otherwise stated.\\n- US buyers only please.\\n- All games will be shipped inside a box with packing, insured,\\n  priority USPS.\\n- All games include all original materials including box, manual,\\n  disks, and registration unless otherwise noted.\\n\\nThe first responder offering asking price is guarenteed to\\nget the game.

Hate what is evil, cling\\n                    to what is good.\"\\n\\n       What is it that Paul, through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit is\\n   calling us to hate?  Would God call us to do something that would\\n   eventually lead to hating our fellow man; especially when he commands us to\\n   do the opposite, to love your fellow man?\\n\\n   >Consider some sin. Now lets apply our \"hate the sin...\" philosophy and see\\n   >what happens. If we truly hate the sin, then the more we see it, the\\n   >stronger our hatred of it will become. Eventually this hate becomes so\\n   >strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to\\n   >hate the sinner.\\n\\n       That has not been my experience.  I\\'ve not found myself hating anybody\\n   as a result of hating the sin that may be in their life.  As a sinner\\n   myself, I find myself having more compassion for the person.  Jesus too,\\n   since the Bible teaches that he was tempted in every way that we are, is\\n   able to have compassion on us when we our tempted and fall.  Jesus is our\\n   very example of HOW to hate the sin but love the sinner.  In the account of\\n   the woman caught in adultery (John 8), Jesus had compassion on the woman;\\n   BUT he also called her to leave her life of sin.  This is what it means to\\n   love sinners but hate their sin; it means loving them unconditionally,\\n   while at the same time calling them to leave their sin.\\n\\n   >In addition, our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and do things\\n   >which are taken personally by the sinner (who often does not even believe\\n   >what they are doing is a sin).\\n\\n       The blame for this can not always be laid at the feet of the\\n   Christian.  I have seen and been guilty of taking offense by someone merely\\n   pointing out my sin and calling me to repent of it.  It was not unloving\\n   for the Christian to call me out of sin; in fact, I believe it was the most\\n   loving thing that that person could have done.  He loved me enough to want\\n   to spare me the consequence of remaining in my sin.\\n\\n   >After enough of this, the sinner begins to hate us (they certainly don\\'t\\n   >love us for our constant criticism of their behavior). Hate builds up and\\n   >drives people away from God...this certainly cannot be a good way to build\\n   >love.\\n\\n       Again, I don\\'t think that you can lay the blame for this at the feet of\\n   the Christian.  If we have loved them as Jesus loved sinners (exemplified\\n   in John 8) and the sinner hates us for it, then we have done the best we\\n   can.  We will have extended to them the most perfect expression of love and\\n   they will have rejected it.\\n\\n       Now it we hate the sin but forget to love the sinner, then indeed, we\\n   will, ourselves, be in sin.\\n\\n   >In the summary of the law, Christ commands us to love God and to love our\\n   >neighbors. He doesn\\'t say anything about hate.\\n\\n       I would like to encourage you to do a word study on HATE in the New\\n   Testament.  I really think that you will be surprised.\\n\\n   >In fact, if anything, he commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves.\\n\\n       Criticism is very different from calling a sinner to repent.\\n\\n   Hope this helps,\\n   In Christ,\\n   Tony Balsamo\\n--\\n\\n            +--------------------------------------------------+\\n            |   Name: Antonio L.

Normal {asynchronous}\\n SCSI is 5 Mhz;  fast {synchronous} SCSI is 10 Mhz.  Difference between these\\n modes is mainly in the software drivers.\\n Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal \\n terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port \\n {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and end. \\n Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. \\nSCSI-1:  8-bit; 7 devices per SCSI controller.  asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}\\n and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  8-bit SCSI-2 is often mistaken for\\n a fast version of SCSI-1 {see SCSI-2 for details}.\\nSCSI-2: fully SCSI-1 compliant. SCSI-2 mode - 10 devices per SCSI controller.\\n 8-bit SCSI-2 is implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it can run using\\n SCSI-1 hardware and software drivers which limits it to 7 devices, which\\n results in it sometimes being mistakenly consitered part of SCSI-1.  16-bit\\n and 32-bit SCSI-2 require different ports, electronics, and SCSI software\\n drivers from SCSI-1 {Which makes them more expensive than other SCSI\\n interfaces}.  32-bit SCSI seems to run only in synchronous mode, hence term\\n 'wide and fast SCSI' Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit},\\n 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst\\n {32-bit}.\\n\\n8-bit SCSI-2 is the BIGGEST headache due to the fact that it is the ONLY SCSI-2 \\nthat I know of that can pump SCSI-2 speeds through SCSI-1 devices and software\\ncontrolers.  Its MAIN implimentation is on the Mac though you do see adds\\nfor SCSI-2 at 10MB/s maximum throughput for PCs.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 does NOT\\nNEED all the hardware {including electonics} and software of 16-bit and 32-bit\\nSCSI-2 it is the CHEEPEST of the SCSI-2 interfaces.  Just pop out the SCSI-1\\nelectornics and pop in 8-bit SCSI-2 electronics.  Some people consider\\n16-bit where SCSI-2 REALLY starts {I USED to be one of them} but\\n4-6MB/s average though put with a theoretical burst of 10MB/s is NOT SCSI-1\\nbut is 8-bit SCSI-2.\\nRule of thumb: if it is SCSIn and OVER 5MB/s then it is SOME type of SCSI-2.\\n\\n8-bit SCSI CAN use part of SCSI-1 electronics which further reduces its cost\\ncompared to 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2.\\n\",\n",

As far as the disk is\\nconcerned, you are limited only by the amount of contiguous free space.\\nThe limit that causes the message, \"Windows will only use ...,\" is the\\namount of virtual address space that the Virtual Memory Manager will\\ncreate, and this is a function of the amount of free memory that you have\\nwhen Windows starts.\\n\\nIn the [386enh] section of SYSTEM.INI, you can specify a parameter:\\n\\n\\tPageOverCommit=multiplier\\n\\nThe following description is from the Windows Resource Kit:\\n\\n\\tThis entry specifies the multiplier what determines the amount of\\n\\tlinear address space the VMM will create for the system, which is\\n\\tcomputed by rounding up the amount of available physical memory to\\n\\tthe nearest 4 MB and then multiplying that value by the value\\n\\tspecified for PageOverCommit=.  Increasing this value increases the\\n\\tamount of available linear address space, causing the size of data\\n\\tstructures to increase.  This also increases paging activity\\n\\tproportionately and can slow down the system.  You can specify a\\n\\tvalue between 1 and 20.  The default is 4.  To change this entry,\\n\\tyou must edit SYSTEM.INI.\\n\\n--\\nBob Nichols\\nAT&T Bell Laboratories\\nrnichols@ihlpm.ih.att.com\\n',\n",

Using alternating currents of high frequency to \\'illuminate\\'\\n  their subjects, they photographed them.  They found that if an object\\n  was a good conductor (such as a metal) the picture showed only its\\n  surface, while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inner\\n  structure of the object even if it were optically opaque.  They found\\n  too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead\\n  and living objects.  Dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones\\n  were subject to changes.  The object\\'s life activity was also visible in\\n  highly variable colour patterns.\\n\\n  High frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in\\n  the Soviet Union but only a few people in the West have taken it up\\n  seriously.  Professor Douglas Dean in New York and Professor Philips at\\n  Washington University in St Louis have produced Kirlian photographs and\\n  others have been produced in Brazil, Austria and Germany.\\n\\n  Using Kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around people\\'s\\n  fingers, notably around those of healers who are concentrating on\\n  healing someone.  Normally, blue and white rays emanate from the fingers\\n  but, when a subject becomes angry or excited, the aura turns red and\\n  spotty.  The Soviets are now using Kirlian photography to diagnose\\n  diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other method.  They argue that\\n  in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the person\\n  isn\\'t actually ill but is about to be.  They claim to be able to\\n  foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase.\\n\\n  But the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by Kirlian photography is\\n  the phantom effect.  During high frequency photography of a leaf from\\n  which a part had been cut, the photograph gave a complete picture of the\\n  leaf with the removed part showing up faintly.  This is extremely\\n  important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can \\'see\\'\\n  the legs of amputees as if they were still there.  The important thing\\n  about the Kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern\\n  can\\'t possibly represent a secondary phenomenon -- or the field would\\n  vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished.  The energy grid\\n  contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than\\n  the actual object itself.\\n\\n  [...]\\n\\n  Kirlian photography has shown how water mentally \\'charged\\' by a healer\\n  has a much richer energy field around it than ordinary water...\\n\\n\\nFrom the incredulous side: [MacRobert, Alan, \"Reality shopping; a\\nconsumer\\'s guide to new age hokum.\", _Whole Earth Review_, Autumn 1986,\\nvNON4 p4(11).

Many paranormal\\n  movements can be traced back to such people -- Kirlian photography, for\\n  instance.  If you pump high-voltage electricity into anything it will\\n  emit glowing sparks, common knowledge to electrical workers and\\n  hobbyists for a century.  It took a lone basement crank to declare that\\n  the sparks represent some sort of spiritual aura.

Their conclusion: The\\n  variations observed in Kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture on\\n  the surface of the body and not to mysterious \"auras\" or even\\n  necessarily to changes in mood or mental state.

If the wages of sin is the above paragraph, then\\n>JESUS DIDN\\'T PAY FOR OUR SINS, DID HE?\\n\\nThis is something I\\'ve always found a little curious. I\\'ve never quite understood\\nthe trinity thing. On the one hand, Jesus is supposed to be God incarnate. But,\\nat the same time, he is God\\'s son \"For God so loved the world that he gave his\\nonly begotten son\". First question is, if Jesus was God in human form, how could\\nhe really be God\\'s son? If the Holy Ghost \"planted the seed\" in Mary, so to speak,\\nthen it seems that Jesus\\' relationship to God would be the equivalent to the\\nhuman father/son relationship. While a son might inherit alot of the father\\'s \\nqualities, he is not the father. They are still two separite entities. To try\\nand say that a son is the same person as the father is obviously wrong. In that\\ncase, Jesus and God aren\\'t the same. On the other hand, if their relationship\\nisn\\'t the same as the human father/son relationship, but Jesus is actually God\\nincarnate, then he\\'s not really God\\'s son and he never was. He\\'s just God\\nmanifesting himself as Jesus. At least, this is how I\\'m seeing it. Can someone\\nwho is more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten us? \\n\\nGetting back to the original question, what is the great price that Jesus paid\\nto redeem our sins? Was it dying on the cross? Since Jesus knew that he would\\nrise again in 3 days and then ascend back to heaven, I have a hard time seeing\\nhow this is considered paying such a great price for humanity. His earthly body\\nmay have been killed, but then, so what? He suffered a few hours of physical\\npain, but then, there has been many a human who has suffered a great deal more.\\nThe fact that Jesus was God\\'s only begotten son doesn\\'t seem to me to have much\\nmeaning since God can beget as many sons as he wants to. Jesus being the only\\none was simply a matter of choice. I suspect that these questions will be very\\noffensive to many Christians on this net. To those people, please accept my\\nsincere apologies. It is not my intention to offend or to trivialize Christ.\\nBut, I do believe these are legitimate questions and I am genuinely curious.\\n \\n[Note that the Trinity and Incarnation have to be looked at together.\\nFirst, your reading of the Virgin Birth is an uncommon one.  (In this\\ngroup, it\\'s dangerous to say that no one believes something.)  You\\nseem to be suggesting the Jesus is God\\'s son in a physical sense,\\nwith the Holy Spirit as Father and Mary as Mother.  I consider that\\nterrible heresy, though some people react less violently.  The Virgin\\nBirth says that Jesus\\' birth is God\\'s responsibility.  But it doesn\\'t\\nimply that God\\'s sperm was involved.  Indeed one (though by no means\\nthe only) speculation is that God used Joseph\\'s genetic material.\\n\\nSecond, Jesus is in some sense doubly indirect from the Father.  In a\\nTrinitarian context, the term Son refers to the eternal Logos, who is\\na part of God.  The Son didn\\'t come into existence with Jesus\\' birth.\\nJesus is the incarnation of the Son.  So his sonness isn\\'t\\nspecifically a result of being incarnated.  Rather, it\\'s the Son\\nwho was incarnated.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

We ran into one of my relatives at the \\nbus station and got to talking. A lot of people had gathered not far away,\\nnear the store. Well at first we didn\\'t know what was happening, and then a\\nfellow I know comes up to me, an Azerbaijani guy, and says, \"What are you\\nstanding here for? Go home immediately!\" I asked, \"What\\'s going on?\" He says, \\n\"What\\'s the matter, can\\'t you see, they\\'ve overturned a car and they\\'re \\nkilling Armenians!\" He helped me catch a cab and we got home safely.\\n\\nWe sat at home for two days. During that time a gang of bandits came into our \\ncourtyard. But the neighbors wouldn\\'t let them in the building. There were \\nabout 80 of them. They had sticks and pieces of armatures in their hands. They\\nwere shouting something, but you couldn\\'t understand it. It wasn\\'t one voice \\nor two, all of them were shouting in a chorus. They turned toward Building 35.\\nThey went up to the third _floor, and we see that they\\'re breaking glass and \\nthrowing things out the window. After a while they come out the entryway: one \\nhas a pair of jeans in his hands, another has a tape recorder, and a third a \\nguitar. They went on toward the auto parts store.\\n\\nWe had to save ourselves. After midnight on March 1 we went to hide at School \\nNo. 33, which is in Microdistrict 13. There were two other Armenian families \\nthere with us. There were 13 of us altogether. Out of all of them I had only \\nknown Ernest before, he had moved to Sumgait from Kirovabad. The Azerbaijani \\nguard at the school let us in. At first he didn\\'t want to, but there was \\nnowhere else for us to go. We had to plead with him and talk him into it. We \\nwere told that on that day, the 1st, there would be an attack on our \\nmicrodistrict.\\n\\nWe went upstairs to a classroom on the second floor.\\n\\nOn the city radio station they announced three telephone numbers that could be\\nused to summon assistance or communicate anything important. I called one of \\nthem and the First Secretary of the Sumgait City Party Committee answered. I\\nasked him for assistance. I say, \"We\\'re in School No. 33, we need to be \\nevacuated.\" Well he says, \"Got it, wait there, I\\'m sending out help now.\"\\n\\nI know his voice. The First Secretary had been to our plant, I had spoken with\\nhim personally. When I called he said, \"Muslimzade here.\"\\n\\nAbout two hours after the call we heard shouts near the school. We looked out\\nthe window and about 100 to 120 people were outside saying, \"Armenians, come \\nout, we\\'re here to get you.\" They have clubs, axes, and armature shafts in \\ntheir hands. The guard sat there with us, and asked, \"Where should I go?\" I \\nsay, \"If your life is of any value to you you\\'ll go down there and say that \\nthe Armenians were here and that they left.\" That\\'s what he did. He went down \\nthere and said, \"The Armenians were here,\" he said, \"I let them out the back \\ndoor, they went that way.\" And pointed with his hand. And with shouts and \\nnoise the mob set off in the direction he had pointed.\\n\\nSo the assistance we had been promised did come. They sent us help, all right!\\nInstead of sending real soldiers he had sent his own. I am positive that\\nMuslimzade did that. No one had seen us entering the school, no one knew that \\nwe were there. In any case, we stayed at the school until seven in the \\nmorning, and no soldiers of any sort came to our aid.\\n\\nIn the morning we went to my relative\\'s in Microdistrict 1, and the soldiers \\ntook us to the SK club from there. The club was jammed with people, and there \\nwere lots of people ahead of us--there was no space available. One small boy, \\nabout three months old, died right in my arms. There wasn\\'t a single doctor, \\nnothing. The boy was uninjured, there were no wounds or bruises on him. He was\\njust very ill. They gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, they did everything\\nthey could under the circumstances, but were unable to save him. And his \\nmother and father, a young Armenian couple, were right there, on the floor ...\\n\\nI searched for a spot for us in the SK, we have a small child of our own, I\\nwanted to find a room or something to put my family in. I went up to the third\\nfloor, there were a lot of soldiers up there, bandaged, with canes, limping, \\nwith their heads broken open. They were a terrible sight. Young guys, all of \\nthem.\\n\\nThere were a lot of bandaged Armenians, too. Everyone had been beaten, \\neveryone was crying, wailing, and calling for help. I think that the City\\nParty Committee ignored us completely. True, there was a snack bar: a sausage \\nwas 30 kopeks or 40 kopeks, a package of cookies that cost 26 kopeks was being\\nsold for 50, a bottled soft drink cost a ruble . . . But there was no way to \\nget the things any cheaper.\\n\\nI met my old uncle, Aram Mikhailovich, there. He saw me and tears welled up in\\nhis eyes. My whole life he had told me that we were friendly peoples, that we \\nworked together, he always had Azerbaijanis over at his house. And now he saw \\nme and there was nothing he could say, he just cried.

So, I rely one the one who can see, hear, and\\ntaste everything, and knows what is real, and what is not.\\nThat is God.\\n\\n\\tOf course, you may ask, if I cannot trust my own senses,\\nhow do I know whether what I see and hear about God is truth or\\na lie.  That is why we need faith to be saved.  We must force\\nourselves to believe that God knows the truth, and loves us\\nenough to share it with us, even when it defies what we think\\nwe know.  Why would He have created us if He did not love us \\nenough to help us through this world?\\n\\n\\tI also do trust my experiences to some extent.  When\\nI do things that defy the seeming logic of my experience, \\nbecause it is what my Father commands me to do, and I see\\nthe results in the long term, I find that He has led me\\nin the proper direction, even though it did not feel right\\nat the time.  This is where our works as Christians are\\nimportant:  As exercises of the body make the body strong,\\nexcercises of faith make the faith strong.  \\n\\n\\tAs for you, no one can \"convert\" you.  You must\\nchoose to follow God of your own will, if you are ever to\\nfollow Him.  All we as Christians wish to do is share with\\nyou the love we have received from God.  If you reject that,\\nwe have to accept your decision, although we always keep\\nthe offer open to you.  If you really want to find out\\nwhy we believe what we believe, I can only suggest you try\\npraying for faith, reading the Bible, and asking Christians\\nabout their experiences personally.  Then you may grow to\\nunderstand why we believe what we do, in defiance of the\\nlogic of this world.\\n\\n\\tMay the Lord bring peace to you, \\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\tMalcusco         \\n',\n",

But the demonstration of this\\nproduct really impressive, if it didn't cheat.\\n\\nThe setup of the demo is fairly simple. A cone shaped rotor is\\nhalf submerged in a small oil sink, filled with motor oil. The rotor\\nis powered by an electronic motor. A metal pad is pressed against\\nthe rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction. \\nThe torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench.\\n\\nBefore MILITECH was added, the rotor was stopped with about 60 lb-ft\\nof torque (You pick the brand of oil, no difference). Once MILITECH was \\nadded to the oil, the rotor could not be stopped even with 120+ lb-ft of\\ntorque. \\n\\nHere is the good part: even after the salesman emptied the oil sink, \\nyou still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained  on it.\\n\\nThey say you need only add 2oz per quart of oil every 15k miles. A 16 oz\\nbottle is $25.\\n\\nI still have my doubts. If this product is really so great, why it was\\nso little known? The salesman said it is widely used in military. I didn't\\nbelieve it.  The demo was so impressive, that I bought a bottle against\\nmy common sense.\\n\\nHas anyone heard of or actually used this product?

Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as \\nthey ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to \\njournalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts \\nof the hills.\\n\\nThe Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING \\nof AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians \\nlast week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death \\nor missing... \\n\\nSeven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter \\nas we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there \\nwas a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer \\nripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We \\nswung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon \\nunder our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.\\n\\nWe had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round \\nagain, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a \\nvalley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung \\nround again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired \\nrepeated blasts.\\n\\nLater it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting \\nhad landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed \\nenclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in \\nfact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter. \\nI had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window, \\nits cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on \\n\"our side\". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a \\nsearch-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.\\n\\nOur flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two \\nM24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed \\nflying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second \\ncrocodile. The civilian helicopter\\'s job was to land in the mountains \\nand pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters \\nwere there to give covering fire if necessary.\\n\\nThe operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet \\narmed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani \\nofficial told us that there were now five former Soviet military \\nhelicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. \"They have \\nsigned contracts to fly for us,\" he said. The helicopter we engaged \\nin combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian \\npilot, but fighting for the Armenians.\\n\\nWe had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an \\nheated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer \\nwhite wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four \\ncorpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an \\nAzerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies \\non the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back \\ntowards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before \\nthe plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.\\n\\nBack at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the \\ncivilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were \\ncovered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor \\nmortis. They had been shot.\\n\\nWhat did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave, \\nand the war in Nagorno-Karabakh?

Let us say a little\\nThe ONLY unity I\\'ve found which is true is when all parties involved are\\ndisciples.  I came out of a church in which even the different\\ncongregations were always competing and arguing about which one was\\nbetter and who had the better messages (while none of them put anything\\ninto practice from those messages).  Since becoming a disciple, I\\'ve\\nfound that when I travel to another church in the same movement, they\\nare just as accepting there as any other.  We had a retreat back in\\nJanuary when some of the congregation from Louisville, KY came up (this\\nretreat was for college students) and it was as though I had known even\\nthe people from Louisville for years (and I had only become a disciple\\nthe previous April and had never been to the church in Kentucky).  One\\nof the keys to unity is unselfish love and self-sacrifice.  That is only\\none area in which disciples stand out from \"Christians\".  Also, another\\npart of unity is a common depth of conviction.  I\\'ve also been a part of\\nsome \"Christian\" campus fellowships who were focused on unity between\\nchurches and saw that those churches had one thing involved:  a lack of\\nconviction about everything they believed.  That was why they could be\\nunified, they didn\\'t care about the truth but delighted in getting along\\ntogether.\\n\\n>The problem here in The Netherlands is that there are two other churches\\n>(denominations) with the same characteristics. Both have the same\\n>confessions; there are only some differences with respect to - for\\n>example - the matter of appropriation of salvation and how to \"use\"\\n>our creeds. In essence a lot of people of these three churches have to\\n>same faith and feel that they should become one church. But how, that is\\n>the question.\\n>\\nCreeds?  What need is there of creeds when the Bible stands firmly\\nbetter?\\n\\n>So, here is a first question:\\n>- can the congregation of Christ be separated by walls of different\\n>  denominations? Or is this definitely an untolerable situation\\n>  according to the Scriptures?\\n\\nAccording to the Scriptures, splits and differences of opinion are going\\nto be there.  As per a previous note, I mentioned that there are those\\nwho teach falsely by many means.  There are also differences of opinion\\nand belief.  However, Scripture states:  \\n   In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your\\nmeetings do more harm than good.  In the first place, I hear that when\\nyou come together as a church, there re divisions among you, and to some\\nextent I believe it.  No doubt there have to be differences among you to\\nshow which of you have God\\'s approval (1 Corinthians 11:17-19).\\n\\nHow will God show his approval?  By fruitfulness (see Acts 2:47), but\\nbefore that, there are these qualities:\\n   devotion to the apostles teaching\\n   fellowship\\n   communion\\n   filling with awe for God\\n   all having everything in common.\\n   glad and sincere hearts\\n   praising God\\n   enjoying the favor of the people\\nAll these are mentioned in Acts 2:42-47.  God also shows that those who\\nhave these qualities are persecuted.  Look at Stephen, \"a man full of\\nfaith and of the Holy Spirit\" (Acts 6:5) who was later stoned (Acts\\n7:54-60).  \\n\\n>- can one say that only one of these three churches is the\\n>  true church of Jesus Christ?\\n\\nOne can say that a church is the true church only if that church is\\nperfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement.  I\\nhave yet to find that, but the closest one I\\'ve found is the Boston\\nChurch of Christ movement, which constantly strives to have errors\\npointed out and corrected.  It is also the only one I\\'ve seen which is\\ntotally sold out to God.\\n\\n>\\n>A problem closely related to these question is:\\n>- can we cooperate with other Christians - from these two churches - \\n>  before there is a unity? This question is especially important\\n>  for those who think that only one church can be the \"true one\".\\n>\\nAs for cooperation, that can always occur.  Unity, on the other hand may\\nnever occur.  As for those who think about only one church being the\\n\"true one\", I remind them that Mark 9:38-41 states that there are\\ndisciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with, but they\\nwill not lose their reward.  As with the Boston movement, I\\'ve heard\\nnumerous times this exact same thing, that there are disciples out there\\nthat are not a part of the Boston movement but that does not make them\\nany less disciples.  Of course, few people admit that they\\'ve ever run\\ninto someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement.\\nI know I haven\\'t.\\n\\n>Maybe this last problem sounds a little strange to most of you.\\n>For your information: we have a lot of organizations here which\\n>are founded by people of one specific church and whose members\\n>are all members of that church. This has been considered as\\n>\"correct\" for years. Only a few years ago people started to\\n>discuss about this and now we are in the middle of this process.\\n>Some organizations are opening their doors for people from\\n>other churches etc.\\n>\\nI must warn that this sounds cliquey to me.  A clique is a group which\\nruns around together to some extent exclusively.  This causes problems\\nin fellowship and causes divisions.  I would not say at all that this is\\nsomething \"correct\" for a church/group to do for any reason.  In one of\\nthe churches I attended, for example, there was an internal clique of\\npeople who were on the 14 different groups/committees/organizational\\nheads of the congregation.  They rarely talked to anyone else outside of\\nthe committees and seldom were voted out of office without another\\noffice being \"opened up\" so that they would have to step right back in.\\nTheir degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came, he\\nnearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch (I wish he\\nwould\\'ve since they still have no clue about what it means to be a\\ndisciple).  Anyway, this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be\\nbroken down, but is still there.  So, I must warn against such division\\nwithin.  There\\'s enough division without.\\n\\n>Thanks for your opinions in advance!\\n>\\n>Maarten\\n\\nJoe Fisher\\n',\n",

This is in response to a question about\\nthe Immaculate Conception.  I explained it, but left justification\\nup to our Catholic readers.  --clh]\\n\\nThere is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for the\\nmention of Mary\\'s _blessedness_/full of grace in the \"Annunciation\" by\\nAngel Gabriel in Luke 1:26-28\\n\\n And in the 6th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto\\n a city of Galilee, named Nazareth.  To a virgin espoused to a\\n man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin\\'s\\n name was Mary.  And the angel came unto her and said, _\"Hail,\\n thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed\\n art thou among women.\"_\\n\\nNow, now, hold that line of thought - \"the Lord is with Mary &\\nblessed art thou among women\" - while you read on....\\n\\nIn the book, \"First Lady of the World, A Popular History of\\nDevotion to Mary\" by Peter Lappin:\\n\\nThe _Immaculate Conception_ matter is really far more complicated\\nthan the _Assumption_.  This arose in 430 AD.  It is quite possible\\nthat the feast of _Mary\\'s Conception_ under the title \"The Conception\\nof Saint Anne\", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of\\na woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter,\\njust as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist.  A transfer in\\nemphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle\\nof grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_.  Mary\\nis the incorruptible timber \"out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_\\nof Christ\\'s sinless body\"; she is \"God\\'s Eden, in whom there is\\nno tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms.\"  Her perfect\\nbeauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ, her\\npurity in that of the Father.  At the time of the Council of Ephesus,\\nshe was hailed as \"innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate,\\nspotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily from\\namong thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve\".\\n...\\nAt the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan,\\nJohn Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a \\ngreater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from all\\nsin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_.\\n...\\n\\nNow let\\'s go to the discussion of baptism and original sin.\\nFrom \"Pocket Catholic Cathechism\" by John A. Hardon:\\n\\nBaptism -\\nConcupiscence Remains after Baptism.\\nConcupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized\\nbut since it is left to provide trial, it has no power to\\ninjure those who do not consent and who by the grace of\\nChrist Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).\\n\\nOriginal gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall:\\nIn the light of the foregoing, we see that our first\\nparents were originally gifted three times over:\\n-They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the\\n power to think and to choose freely.\\n-The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality\\n and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires.\\n-They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace,\\n the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding\\n title to enter heaven.\\nBy their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural and\\npreternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (without\\nlosing) their natural capacity to reason and to choose\\nfreely.\\n\\nBaptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam\\'s\\nsin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts\\nbut gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our\\nbodies on the last day...\\n\\nGoing back to _Immaculate Conception_\\n(I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other\\nbooks but it may be another contribution to the \\'puzzle\\'):\\n\\nGiven the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at a\\nnon-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born \\nAND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary\\'s birth but\\nSTILL, the Angel Gabriel\\'s greetings was:\\n\"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you.\\nBlessed art thou amongst women\".\\n\\nEven Mary was confused about this greeting.\\n\\nMary could very well have possessed all of the\\n_treefold original gifts above_ given to our first\\nparents (Adam and Eve before their sin):\\n    Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel)\\n    Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural)\\n    The Lord is with you (At those times, God would\\n                definitely want to be with those He\\n                has made _blessed_)\\n    Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)\\n\\nAt the conception, God made Mary _full of grace\\nand blessed_ as the \\'tabernacle\\' for the coming body\\nof Christ and so,\\n\\nImmaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still\\nhas maintained her Immaculate Heart. \\n\\n-Marida\\n(P.S.

Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.)\\n\\nTopics\\n------\\n\\nDon\\'s Tie, Grant Fuhr, Penalties, Wings vs Leafs, Fighting, Dale Hunter.\\n\\nEpisode Summary\\n---------------\\n\\nThis episode began with the camera zoomed in on Don\\'s tie. Don was\\npointing out the characters on the tie... Bugs Bunny, Foghorn Leghorn,\\nand Yosemite Sam (who Don called Lanny Macdonald.)\\n\\nRon Maclean began by mentioning that Don was almost evicted from a\\nhotel where he was watching the previous night\\'s games, because of\\nall the yelling and cheering he was doing over the play of Hunter\\nand Fuhr.\\n\\nDon began to praise Fuhr, calling him the \"greatest goalie\", and\\nsaid that he\\'s winning the series against Boston all by himself.\\nHe then showed clips from earlier episodes (Nov. 14, Jan. 16) when\\nFuhr was still with the Leafs, and Don advised \"Don\\'t Trade Fuhr!\"\\n\\nDon went on to predict that if Buffalo gets by Boston, it would\\nbe Fuhr who wins the series. Muckler took a lot of heat for the\\ntrade, but Don feels Muckler\\'s been vindicated.\\n\\nThe next topic involved how playoff games are being ruined by\\ntoo many penalty calls. He showed a clip from a Winnipeg-Vancouver\\ngame, where Domi hit a Vancouver player, and was given a 2 min. penalty.\\nRon said that it was called a penalty because his stick was involved,\\nbut Don stuck with the opinion that it was a good hit, with Domi\\nhitting the Vancouver player with his shoulder. Don: \"Its sad what\\nthey\\'re doing for hockey... a 5 minute penalty for a nosebleed.\"\\n\\nNext, they went to the playoff series between Detroit and Toronto.\\nPeople in Detroit were calling Wendel Clarke \"Wendy\" for not fighting.\\nHowever, Don pointed out that Probert was not fighting either.\\n\\nThis lead Don into a tirad about fighting and stickwork, and how\\nbanning fighting leads to more high sticking: \"It\\'s like college\\nhockey... The little wee guy with the visor is brave as anybody.\\nThat\\'s why you\\'re seeing so much stickwork. Because they know you\\nwon\\'t drop your gloves and give them a shot. The rules are made\\nby people who don\\'t know what\\'s going on in hockey\".\\n\\nThe final topic Don discussed was Dale Hunter. Don pointed out\\nthat he was leading the league in goals, and showed a clip\\nof Hunter from a previous game. When he was younger, Hunter was\\ntaught to \"play to win\", which differs from today\\'s idea of\\njust letting kids have fun.\\n\\nAt then end of the episode, they showed a clip from a coach\\'s\\ncorner, with the tape on fast forward, so that Don sounded like\\none of the chipmunks.\\n\\nRating\\n------\\nTypical anti-fighting posturing, not too much humour, but some\\ngood quotes.\\n\\nI\\'d give it a 7.0 out of 10.\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n   \\\\  \\\\                   |Allan Sullivan (allan@cs.ualberta.ca)\\n    \\\\  \\\\                  |Department of Computing Science,\\n     \\\\  \\\\_______          |University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.\\n      \\\\    ###  \\\\     _   |---------------------------------------------------\\n       \\\\___###___\\\\   (_)  |My opinions are mine and mine alone.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\"It is amazing how much can be accomplished if no one cares who gets the\\n credit...\"          - U. of A.

But I can\\'t guarantee that I\\'m not way off base...\\n\\nThe permenant swap file is read/written to by windows by talking\\ndirectly to the hard disk controller card.  The controller card must\\nuse the protocal set up by western digital (or something like that).\\nWindows creates a file called spart.par in your windows directory that\\npoints to that file.  It then uses the physical information about your\\ndisk to index to information in that file.\\n\\ncompressed disks are actually \"logical\" disks.  These disks have different\\ncharacteristics than the actual physical disk.  Furthermore, the information\\non the compressed disks must be uncompressed before it is used.  (i.e it must\\ngo through the decompression program that traps disk reads at the operating\\nsystem level or the BIOS level).  Because of this \"inbetween\" program, windows\\ncannot use direct methods to read from the \"logical\" disk.\\n\\na permenant swap file is only there to \"reserve\" an area of the disk that\\nwindows can use and to block that space from DOS.  Windows would theoretically\\nnot even have to access the file from DOS to use that disk space. (I don\\'t\\nknow if it does or doesn\\'t...but it checks for it somewhere everytime you\\nboot windows.)\\n\\na temporary swap file is just a normal DOS file that is accessed by windows\\nvia DOS and the BIOS.  If a disk compression program or other TSR is loaded\\nthe file access must go through DOS...TSR\\'S (disk compression)...and BIOS in\\norder to be access. (i.e. NEVER USE A TEMPORARY SWAP FILE...NEVER)\\n\\nmore on permenent swap files...\\n\\ni\\'m sure everyone who has an uncompressed part of their compressed hard disk\\nhas seen the message \"you have selected a swap file greater than the suggested\\nsize...windows will only use the size suggested...do you wan\\'t to create this\\nswap file anyway\" or something like that.\\n\\nwell, a friend of mine (ROBERT) called microsoft and asked them what and why.\\nwhat they said is that windows checks the amount of free disk space and\\ndivides that number by 2.  Then it checks for the largest contiguous block\\nof free disk space.  Windows then suggests the smaller of the two numbers.\\n\\nThey also said that under absolutely no circumstances...NONE!...will windows\\nuses a swap file larger than the suggested size.

Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)\\n\\torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a\\n\\tnegative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other\\n\\tadvantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort\\n\\tmaneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of\\n\\tthe horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining\\n\\tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target\\n\\tin second stage.\"\\n\\n    This really is a good answer, but it\\'s couched in NASA jargon. I\\'ll try\\n    to interpret.\\n\\n    1)\\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.\\n\\n    2)\\tThen, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack\\n\\tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the\\n\\t\"relative wind\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line\\n\\tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly\\n\\tnegative angle (\"a negative q-alpha\").\\tThis causes a little bit of\\n\\t\"downward\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z\\n\\tdirection) and this force \"alleviates structural loading.\"\\n\\tWe have to be careful about those wings -- they\\'re about the\\n\\tmost \"delicate\" part of the vehicle.\\n\\n    3)\\tThe new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more\\n\\tmass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or\\n\\tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be\\n\\tthe case if we didn\\'t roll (\"performance gain\").\\n\\n    4)\\tThe new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated\\n\\tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort\\n\\tmaneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\"decreased abort maneuver\\n\\tcomplexity\").\\n\\n    5)\\tThe new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio\\n\\tantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio\\n\\tantennae on the Orbiter (\"improved S-band look angles\").\\n\\n    6)\\tThe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a\\n\\thelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.\\n\\n    7)\\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is\\n\\tmore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east\\n\\t(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity\\n\\tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:\\n\\tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.\\n\\tThe Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its\\n\\tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.\\n\\n    This all begs the question, \"Why isn\\'t the launch pad oriented to give\\n    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to\\n    achieve that attitude?\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers\\n    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one\\n    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main\\n    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime\\n    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is\\n    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \"top\"\\n    [Orbiter side] and the \"bottom\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The\\n    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented\\n    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V\\'s.  (A side note: the\\n    Saturn V\\'s also had a roll program.  Don\\'t ask me why -- I\\'m a Shuttle\\n    guy.)\\n\\n    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.\\tHe added that the \"roll\\n    maneuver\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.\\n    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons\\n    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping\\n    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw\\n    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total\\n    maneuver is really expressed as a \"quaternion,\" a grad-level-math\\n    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element\\n    array.\\n\\n\\n    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT\\n\\n    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite\\n    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72\\n    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed\\n    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from\\n    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.\\n    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite\\n    for these viewers.\\n\\n    If you can\\'t get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.\\n    It\\'s worth asking if yours doesn\\'t.\\n\\n    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is\\n    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press\\n    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle\\n    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying\\n    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions\\n    are not being covered.\\n\\n\\n    AMATEUR RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR SHUTTLE MISSIONS\\n\\n    The following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio:\\n\\n\\tW6FXN  - Los Angeles\\n\\tK6MF   - Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California\\n\\tWA3NAN - Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Greenbelt, Maryland.\\n\\tW5RRR  - Johnson Space Center (JSC), Houston, Texas\\n\\tW6VIO  - Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California.\\n\\tW1AW Voice Bulletins\\n\\n\\tStation    VHF\\t   10m\\t   15m\\t   20m\\t  40m\\t 80m\\n\\t------\\t ------  ------  ------  ------  -----\\t-----\\n\\tW6FXN\\t 145.46\\n\\tK6MF\\t 145.585\\t\\t\\t 7.165\\t3.840\\n\\tWA3NAN\\t 147.45  28.650  21.395  14.295  7.185\\t3.860\\n\\tW5RRR\\t 146.64  28.400  21.350  14.280  7.227\\t3.850\\n\\tW6VIO\\t 224.04\\t\\t 21.340  14.270\\n\\tW6VIO\\t 224.04\\t\\t 21.280  14.282  7.165\\t3.840\\n\\tW1AW\\t\\t 28.590  21.390  14.290  7.290\\t3.990\\n\\n    W5RRR transmits mission audio on 146.64, a special event station on the\\n    other frequencies supplying Keplerian Elements and mission information.\\n\\n    W1AW also transmits on 147.555, 18.160.

Random Misconfigured Site\\nLines: 60\\n\\n\\n\\tThe problems with Catholic liturgy are likely to continue for\\nsome time.  The problem is, in a nutshell, this: the Liturgy is a\\nsymbolic action - in other words Catholics do [or should] believe that\\nthe _signs_ during the mass - Water, Blessings, Vestments, Altar,\\nRelics, etc - are real. That is the sprinkling of water bestows real,\\nalmost tangible, holiness, the Vestments are a real indication of real\\nsacred time. The point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by all\\nto be connected to an underlying REAL referent. This kind of thinking\\nprecludes analysis; holy water is not holy because of anything, it\\nsimply IS holy.\\n\\nBut, modern westerners find it extremely difficult, especially if\\nwell- educated, to think of the mass as a symbol. We are more likely\\nto see it as a _sign_, ie an action that represents grace, but which\\ncould be replaced with other signs. In concrete terms, this means the\\nmass has become a commercial for God\\'s grace rather than the real\\nthing. You can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn\\'t\\ndare with the real thing [ask Coca-Cola Co.!]. These attitudes have\\nbeen encouraged by Liturgy workshops, etc. which instead of focusing\\non _how_ to do do liturgy, have focused on how to create a meaning in\\nliturgy. You can only create signs, symbols have to come from God [or\\nthe heart, or somewhere deeper than analysis. The most dramatic\\nexample of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of\\nthe sacred species [the consecrated host and wine]. Now, with pita\\nbread etc, it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered\\nin particles. If the Host is a sign of Grace, this isnt and issue; but\\nCatholics in the past would have been distraught at this real\\ndesacration of the real symbol of Jesus\\' body.\\n\\nModern Catholic liturgy  is caught in this epistemological shift. We\\ntry to perfrom the old rites, but then we have some liturgomaniac\\npriest get up and \\'explain\\' what we are doing - so we stop doing it and\\nstart pretending to do it. This is not a soul filling experience.\\nIt doesn\\'t help BTW that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and\\nthree chord ersatz-folk music [again a result of mis-analysis: complicated\\ntunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones - this was the\\ngenius of Wesley and the 19C Anglican hymn writers]. Taize\\' is only\\nslightly better.\\n\\nWhat are we to do? Well I suggest rejecting the parish system if it\\ndoesn\\'t work for you. Search out a Church where the liturgy is well\\nprepared not well-explained. They exist in every city. This is not BTW\\na matter of particular style: the music might be old or new. It is\\nthe attitude of the church that counts. Also, note that a conservative\\nliturgy - harking back to pre-Vatican II days, does not necessarily mean\\nthe Church will be socially conservative.\\n\\nIn NYC I can recommend:\\n\\tCorpus Christi - W 12st St.\\n\\tCorpus Christi - W 12st St. - very conservative liturgy, \\n\\tSt. Joseph\\'s, Greenwich Village.  - Modern, \"clean\", largely gay\\n\\tOratorian Church, Brooklyn - Very beautiful\\n\\nAvoid, anywhere, anytime a church with electric candles.\\n\\nHappy Easter: Christos Aneste\\', Christos Voskrezhne, Christ is Risen\\n\\nPaul Halsall\\nHalsall@murray.fordham.edu\\n',\n",

I'm new to motorcycles so no flames please.  I don't\\n>have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information:\\n>\\n>[...]  Any stories on how you all learned?\\n\\nI'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.\\n\\nEarly in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on\\nhis old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I\\nactually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.\\n\\nI proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and\\nrode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to\\ninvest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then\\nI also passed my road test.\\n\\nOn May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a\\n4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb),\\nI had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late,\\nskidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the\\noncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was\\nalso stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under\\na car and been killed.\\n\\nNow this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the\\nExperienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training\\ncould have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater\\nsince you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff\\nas I did.\\n\\nSo my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I\\nwouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you\\nhappen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until\\nyou're ready to use it.\\n\\n>1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have \\n>to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too \\n>ignorant to know I need to buy)\\n\\nWhile you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in\\nDC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you\\nsave up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear,\\nplus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure\\nthe machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up\\nmachine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration\\nand licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not\\nincluding the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.\\n\\n>2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?  I turn 18 in \\n>about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up\\n>till now, and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a \\n>motorcycle is going to insure (I live in Washington DC if that makes\\n>a difference)\\n\\nI pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200\\nin Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial\\ncoverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be\\npoor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo\\nmore expensive.\\n\\n>3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?\\n\\nThere used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle\\nmagazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or\\nrecent models might be available.  You could probably look through\\npast issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first\\nbike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice\\ninstead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that\\nare parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by\\nnoticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around\\nand they were generally set up the way I wanted.\\n\\nNothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting\\nshowrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping,\\nwere very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and\\nquoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence\\ncheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.\\n\\n-- David Karr (karr@cs.cornell.edu)\\n-- '80 BMW R65   DoD #0969   also BMWMOA, NRA, ACLU, et al.\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

The Mariners\\nhad the bases loaded with 1 out.  The batter hits a fly to center, which the\\nfielder catches.  The runner at third tags and scores without a throw.  \\n\\nNow, without a judgement call (and I don\\'t think there is one), this is an RBI\\nfor the batter.  It seems to me that a better name for this would be \"defensive\\nindifference\", since it doesn\\'t really matter whether the guy at third scores\\nat that point.  (I know, I can think of several \"If the Mariners stole third\\nand second, which opening the base would allow, and then the batter hit a\\ngrounder which the third baseman gets deep in the hole between himself and\\nthird, he wouldn\\'t have a play at home, third, or second for the out, and\\nmaybe he therefore can\\'t make the throw to first to get the last out, etc...\\nscenarios, too.  But does it _really_ matter if this guy scores this way when\\nyou\\'re down by 4?  If the tying run is going to score, so is the guy on third.)\\n\\nThe point is that the batter (IMO) shouldn\\'t get \"credit\" (an RBI) for utterly\\nfailing to do his job - which at this point is to get a hit or a walk, not\\ntrade an out for one run.

He was a murderer from the \\n          beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in \\n          him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a \\n          liar, and the father of it. (John 8:41-44)\\n\\n          And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, [thou] child of \\n          the devil, [thou] enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease \\n          to pervert the right ways of the Lord?

Those scholars did indeed have an excellent\\nreason to assume that the suicide was successful.  As I pointed out, I\\nrecently checked several Lexicons:\\n\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\\n\\t\"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\\n\\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\\n\\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \\n\\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\\n\\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\\n\\nA couple simply stated \"hanged oneself\", and a couple were more explicit \\nand stated that \"apacgw\" means specifically \"kill yourself by hanging.\" A\\ncouple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for \"apacgw\" is\\n\"strangle, throttle or choke\" (which pretty much invalidates the guy who\\nsuggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down).  One of the best\\nreferences though, \"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New\\nTestament,\" not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, the\\nliteral translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and also\\nother presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give\\nfurther context).  \\n\\nThe word \"apagchw\" has two root words: \"gchw\" is the \"to strangle\" root, and\\nthe root word \"apo\" means literally \"away.\" This root words is included in\\nwords which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place (eg: the\\ngreek word \"apagello\" means to send a message).  \"Apo\" can also denote a\\nchange in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinson\\nspecifically makes comparison to the word \"apokteiuo,\" which means \"to kill.\"\\nIn literal meaning the word \"apacgw\" means \"to throttle, strangle to put out\\nof the way,\" and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from\\nlife, to death).  So while the word \"apacgw\" does mean \"to hang,\" it\\nspecifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when he\\nstate that it means \"to hang oneself, to end one\\'s life by hanging.\" He then\\nnotes the the use of \"apacgw\" in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  He\\npresents that example of \"apacgw\" as being used to explicitly mean \"suicide by\\nhanging.\" Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the\\nadded denotation of \"death,\" and as you insist that the Bible was written by\\nGod, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete\\nmeaning of \"apacgw\" (ie: Since the word \"apacgw\" was used, then death is\\ndenoted as the result). \\n\\nBy the way, I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of \"apacgw\":\\n\\n> In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus),\\n> it\\'s only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : \"Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice \\n> was not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house,\\n> to his city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and \\n> died; and he was buried in his father\\'s tomb.\"   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n> ^^^^ \\n> Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel \"hanged himself\" [Gr. Sept.,\\n> APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, \"and died\".  Here we have no doubt of the\\n> result.\\n> In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.\\n\\nNote Mr DeCenso, as you say, the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to\\nGreek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie\" the the\\nHebrew say \"and died\"), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek. \\nIt should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added \"and died\", the\\ncorrect translation would still be \"apacgw,\" as the man did indeed die from\\nstrangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that the\\nSeptuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions\\nwhich contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily\\nexecuted by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it\\nnow stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you really need to prove\\nyour point Mr DeCenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing\\n\"apacgw\" and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless\\nassertions without corresponding evidence. \\n\\nNow I would note Mr DeCenso, that everytime I go out of my way to research it\\none of your apparently contrived exegisis, I pretty much find it false.  Thus,\\nI think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above\\nwhat the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit Greek or\\nhistorical source to justify it. \\n\\nBy the way, as to Mr Rose\\'s statement about trees around the Potter\\'s Field:\\n\\n> There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\\n\\nUnless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that\\nthere are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description\\nof the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to\\nassert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two\\nthousand years ago (after all, things change). \\n\\nNow as to your other argument, ie: that the money Judas used is not the same\\nas the 30 silvers:\\n\\n> As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the\\n> money with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather\\n> than some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically\\n> mention \"the reward of iniquity\" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions\\n> what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 \"...concerning\\n> Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.\").  Now I would point out\\n> that when the Bible describes an act of \"iniquity,\" and then immediately\\n> discusses \"*the* reward of iniquity,\" it would be rather inane to suggest that\\n> it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.\"\\n> \\n>  \\n> Notice that in verse 16, the word \"iniquity\" is not used.  Rather, it states\\n> that Judas \"became a guide to those who arrested Jesus\".\\n> But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, \"for he was numbered with us and\\n> obtained a part in this ministry.\"  What part did Judas play in their ministry?\\n>          ^^^^^^\\n\\nTrue, Peter (or the author of Acts) does not specifically call Judas\\' betrayal\\n\"an iniquity,\" but for that matter, neither does John specifically call Judas\\'\\nactions \"an iniquity\" either.  Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas took\\nthe money box, but rather said:\\n\\n    \"Some thought that because, Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling\\n     him \"Buy what we need for the feast\"; or that he should give something\\n     to the poor, So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and\\n     it was night.\"\\n\\nNote that it is said that Judas left, it does not say that he took the money\\nbox.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose\\nthe a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different\\nbook, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by\\nthe author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived. \\n\\nOf course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen\\nevidence that \"apacgw\" means suicide.  You see, since Judas\\' hanging was\\nsuccessful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, because\\nMatthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie:\\nPassover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself\\nthe next day.  Thus the money which bought the \"Field of Blood\" would have to\\nhave been the 30 pieces of silver (Of course he got the 30 pieces of silver\\nthat night as well, and thus couldn\\'t have spent that either.  Oh dear, I\\nbelieve that the house of cards is comming down). \\n\\nMaybe we should at this point, discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on\\nFriday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas.\\n\\nBy the way, as to where the prophesy of the Potter\\'s field came from (ie: the\\nmention of it in Matthew), you say:\\n\\n> Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss\\n> this with you.\\n\\nI am reminding you now to discuss it now.

Rather than use technology to accommodate\\n   the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\\n   law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\\n   industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\\n\\n   Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\\n   protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\\n   protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\\n   technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\\n   unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\\n   by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\\n\\n   A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\\n   been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\\n   new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\\n   relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\\n   an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\\n   using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\\n   commercial use today.\\n\\n   This new technology will help companies protect proprietary\\n   information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\\n   and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\\n   electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\\n   ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\\n   intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \\n\\n   A \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\\n   \"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\\n   Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   2\\n\\n\\n   \"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\\n   agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\\n   device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\\n   in two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\\n   Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\\n   government officials with legal authorization to conduct a\\n   wiretap.\\n\\n   The \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\\n   new authorities to access the content of the private\\n   conversations of Americans.\\n\\n   To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\\n   Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\\n   devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\\n   government will be offered access to the confidential details of\\n   the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\\n   their findings.\\n\\n   The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\\n   encryption\\'s dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\\n   privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\\n   criminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\\n   approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\\n   to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\\n   to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\\n   trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\\n   the President has directed government agencies to develop a\\n   comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\\n\\n\\t--   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\\n\\t     employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\\n\\n\\t--   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\\n\\t     calls and data, under proper court or other legal\\n\\t     order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\\n\\n\\t--   the effective and timely use of the most modern\\n\\t     technology to build the National Information\\n\\t     Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\\n\\t     the competitiveness of American industry in the global\\n\\t     marketplace; and \\n\\n\\t--   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\\n\\t     high technology products.\\n\\n   The President has directed early and frequent consultations with\\n   affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\\n   privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   3\\n\\n   The Administration is committed to working with the private\\n   sector to spur the development of a National Information\\n   Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\\n   technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\\n   information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\\n   (\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\\n   programming, and huge data files as easily as today\\'s telephone\\n   system transmits voice.\\n\\n   Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important\\n   role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\\n   quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\\n   its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\\n   protect all Americans\\' right to privacy while also protecting\\n   them from those who break the law.\\n\\n   Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \\n   The provisions of the President\\'s directive to acquire the new\\n   encryption technology are also available.  \\n\\n   For additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\\n   Standards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\\n\\n   ---------------------------------\\n\\n\\n   QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION\\'S\\n   TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\\n\\tagencies to listen in on phone conversations?\\n\\n   A:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\\n\\tno new authorities to access the content of the private\\n\\tconversations of Americans.\\n\\n   Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\\n\\ta drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\\n\\tencrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\\n\\tdecipher the message?\\n\\n   A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\\n\\tcourt order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\\n\\twould then present documentation of this authorization to\\n\\tthe two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\\n\\tobtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\\n\\tsmugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\\n\\tstored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\\n\\tescrow system.\\n\\n   Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\\n\\n   A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\\n\\tentities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\\n\\tAdministration have yet to determine which agencies will\\n\\toversee the key-escrow data banks.\\n\\n   Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\\n\\thow strong the security is?  \\n\\n   A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\\n\\tsystems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\\n\\tremain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\\n\\tsystem, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\\n\\tcryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\\n\\tpotential users that there are no unrecognized\\n\\tvulnerabilities.\\n\\n   Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\\n\\n   A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\\n\\tCommerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\\n\\tthis decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\\n\\tPresident, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\\n\\tofficials.\\n\\n   Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\\n\\n   A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\\n\\tencryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\\n\\tas we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\\n\\tbriefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\\n\\tdecisions related to this initiative.\\n\\n   Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\\n\\n   A:   The government designed and developed the key access\\n\\tencryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\\n\\tmicrocircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\\n\\tmanufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\\n\\tmanufacturer that produces them.\\n\\n   Q:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\\n\\n   A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\\n\\tCalifornia, and will sell the chip to encryption device\\n\\tmanufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\\n\\tto other vendors in the future.\\n\\n   Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \\n\\n   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\\n\\tthe \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\\n\\n   Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\\n\\tsolution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\\n\\twilling to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\\n\\tpowerful encryption devices?\\n\\n   A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\\n\\tconsidered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\\n\\tmechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\\n\\tthat is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\\n\\tthan others readily available today, but it is just one\\n\\tpiece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\\n\\tencryption technology, which the Administration is\\n\\tdeveloping.\\n\\n\\tThe Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\\n\\tthreatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\\n\\twe will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\\n\\teffectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\\n\\tAmerican, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\\n\\tunbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a\\n\\tfalse \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\\n\\tan \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\\n\\tand in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\\n\\tbalanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\\n\\tChip\" and similar encryption techniques.\\n\\n   Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\\n\\tAdministration\\'s policy toward encryption will differ from\\n\\tthat of the Bush Administration?  \\n\\n   A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\\n\\ttechnology in telecommunications and computing and are\\n\\tcommitted to working with industry and public-interest\\n\\tgroups to find innovative ways to protect Americans\\'\\n\\tprivacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\\n\\tenforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\\n\\tand terrorism.\\n\\n   Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\\n\\tthe government hardware?\\n\\n   A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control\\n\\trequirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is\\n\\trequired to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The\\n\\tsame is true for other encryption devices.  One of the\\n\\tattractions of this technology is the protection it can give\\n\\tto U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this\\n\\tin mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a\\n\\tcase-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these\\n\\tdevices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan\\n\\tto review the possibility of permitting wider exportability\\n\\tof these products.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'From: kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu (Dr Nancy\\'s Sweetie)\\nSubject: Re: Certainty and Arrogance\\nOrganization: Rowan College of New Jersey\\nLines: 122\\n\\nIn an earlier article, I explained that what many people find arrogant about\\nChristians is that some Christians profess absolute certianty about their\\nbeliefs and doctrines.  That is, many Christians insist that they CANNOT have\\nmade any mistakes when discovering their beliefs, which amounts to saying\\nthat they are infallible.\\n\\nImpicitly claiming to be infallible is pretty arrogant, most of us will\\nprobably agree.\\n\\nIn short, the problem is that no matter how good your sources are, if any\\npart of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own thinking and reasoning,\\nthen those doctrines are suspect.  So long as your own brain is involved,\\nthere is a possibility for error.  I summarised the problem by writing \"There\\nis no way out of the loop.\"\\n\\n\\nSomeone called `REXLEX\\' has claimed that there IS a way out of the loop, but\\nhe did not bother to explain what it was, preferring instead to paraphrase\\nSartre, ramble about Wittgenstein, and say that the conclusion of my argument\\nleads to relativism.\\n\\nAs I have explained to him before, you cannot reject an argument as false\\nbecause you dislike where it leads: the facts do not change just because\\nyou dislike them.  `REXLEX\\' wrote:\\n\\n>  I disagree with Dr Nancy\\'s Sweetie\\'s conclusion because if it is\\n> taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.\\n\\nHowever, as any first-year philosophy student can explain, what `REXLEX\\' has\\nwritten does not constitute a refutation.  All he has said is that he does\\nnot like what I wrote -- he has done nothing at all to dispute it.\\n\\n *\\n\\nThere were two sentences in `REXLEX\\'s post that seemed relevant to the\\npoint at hand:\\n\\n>  There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be\\n> experienced and it is verifiable.\\n\\nI do not dispute that some truths can be verified through experience.  I\\nhave, for example, direct experience of adding numbers.  I don\\'t claim to\\nbe infallible at it -- in fact I remember doing sums incorrectly -- but I\\ndo claim that I have direct experience of reasoning about numbers.\\n\\nHowever, once we go past experiencing things and start reasoning about\\nthem, we are on much shakier ground.  That was the point of the earlier\\narticle.  Human brains are infested with sin, and they can only be trusted\\nin very limited circumstances.\\n\\n\\n>  It is only because of God\\'s own revelation that we can be absolute\\n> about a thing.\\n\\nBut how far does that get you?  Once God\\'s revelation stops, and your own\\nreasoning begins, possibility for error appears.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s suppose that our modern Bible translations include a\\nperfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper, and that Jesus said,\\nexactly, \"This is my body.\"\\n\\nWe\\'ll presume that what he said was totally without error and absolutely\\ntrue.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.\\n\\nAt the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the\\npossibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do\\nnot have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of\\nTran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn\\'t say.  We interpret this passage\\nusing our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know\\nthat our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (This\\nis something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)\\n\\nWhy should anyone believe that his reasoning -- which he knows to be\\nfallible -- can lead him to perfect conclusions?\\n\\nSo, given the assumptions in this example, what we can be certain of is\\nthat Jesus said \"This is my body.\"  Beyond that, once we start making up\\ndoctrines and using our brains to reason about what Christ revealed, we\\nget into trouble.\\n\\nUnless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain\\nof.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they\\ncannot be certain.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat is the problem of seeming arrogant.  The non-Christians around us know\\nthat human beings make mistakes, just as surely as we know it.  They do not\\nbelieve we are infallible, any more than we do.\\n\\nWhen Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning can never lead\\nthem astray -- when we implicitly claim that we are infallible -- the non-\\nChristians around us rarely believe that implicit claim.  Witnessing is\\nhardly going to work when the person you are talking to believes that you\\nare either too foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying\\nto cover them up.\\n\\nI think it would be far better to say what things we are certain of and what\\nthings we are only \"very confident\" of.  For example, we might say that we\\nknow our sin, for recognising sin is something we directly experience.  But\\nother things, whether based on reasoning from Scripture or extra-Biblical\\nthinking, should not be labled as infallible: we should say that we are\\nvery confident of them, and be ready to explain our reasoning.\\n\\nBut, so far as I am aware, none of us is infallible -- speaking or acting\\nas if our thinking is flawless is ridiculous.\\n\\n *\\n\\n`REXLEX\\' suggested that people read _He is There and He is Not Silent_, by\\nFrancis Schaeffer.  I didn\\'t think very highly of it, but I think that\\nMr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many Evangelical Christians.  Somebody\\nelse might like it, though, so don\\'t let my opinion stop you from reading it.\\n\\nIf someone is interested in my opinion, I\\'d suggest _On Certainty_, by\\nLudwig Wittgenstein.\\n\\n\\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\\n\"If any substantial number of  [ talk.religion.misc ]  readers read some\\n Wittgenstein, 60% of the postings would disappear.

You can use any\\nold vga/svga monitor with a centris.  You do need an adaptor (I use a\\nMac vga-q from james engineering (510) 525-7350) to run between the two\\nmachines.  THe adaptor I have mentioned will convert a centris to a\\nthree row vga/svga 25(?) pin adaptor for your monitor.\\n\\n    NOW, the special interest disclaimer.\\n The above answer is correct for using a vga monitor at 600x400\\nresolution.  IF your monitor will sync to 56Khz horizontal the above\\nadaptor will allow you to choose 800x600 resolution (I prefer this on my\\n1604s).\\n\\nTHen You have the question of matching adaptors and sync rates.  I would\\nadvocate calling James engineering because they seem to have a clue.  As\\nto the comment by the person who said don\\'t bother calling Apple because\\nthey will treat you like an idiot this is totally untrue.\\n    APPLE WILL TREAT YOU LIKE A F**KING ASSANINE IDIOT FOR EVEN\\nCONSIDERING GOING THIRD PARTY AND IF YOU WANT THIS TREATMENT WANTS YOU\\nTO PAY FOR THEIR THECH SUPPORT LINE (the supposedly compitantly one) AND\\nTHEN STILL HAS NO FU***** CLUE.\\n\\npersonal experience.  also the tech suppport for the vga monitor makers\\ndoesn\\'t see to extend to Macs (Sony, Magnavox).  In addition to this to\\nfind out the info you will have to call dealers unless you can find the\\nsync rates elsewhere as ads like Hardware that fits\\n(*&^%&%^%$$(&**&^(%&%^$!) that rate monitor resolutions give the most\\nfavorable rating (which usually means you can get this if you use a\\nspecialized application video card).(i.e. \"well you can get a resolution\\n1168x832 on this $5,  9\" \"super smelly sock\" monitor that will let you\\ndisplay TWO FULL PAGES side by side.  All you need is our reasonably\\npriced \"oder eater\" video board for $27,000 and it will give you an\\nultra fast horizontal sync rate of SIX fast kilohertz and three Khz\\nvertical.\")\\n\\n\\n\\nNote:  with the sony 1604 at least on the centris 610 built in video\\nboard using an 832x624 adaptor, there is a boarder of an inch + to the\\nsides of the image after adjusting the horizontal width as favorably as\\npossible.

In a like manner, one who has no \\'legitimate need\\'\\n(gov\\'t definition) for strong crypto software or systems, and is caught\\nusing them, might find themselves in possession of \\'terrorist tools\\'.\\nIn other words, if one is not working for a corporation with extremely\\nsensitive commercial data that warrants (in the Fed\\'s opinion) strong\\nsecurity, or a government agency, and securing only work-related data,\\nnot personal data, one will most likely be nailed on this if discoverd.\\nA personal desire for \\'privacy\\' most certainly will not be regarded as\\na \\'legitimate NEED\\': \\n\"Why do you want such strong security, especially from \\'legitimate law\\nenforcement\\'?

Are you suspicious\\nyet of what\\'s going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n  >>> import numpy as np\\n  >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n  ...     feature_names = np.asarray(vectorizer.get_feature_names())\\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n  ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n  ...\\n  >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n- The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n  previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n  wrote:\"\\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n  were posting at the time.\\n\\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\nsame high level.\\n\\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n``(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.77310...\\n\\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.76995...\\n\\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task.
